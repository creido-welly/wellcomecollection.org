We all work in the **open** and **open source** where we can and where it makes sense

We put **users** **at the centre** of all decisions. We use **evidence and insight** to inform these decisions at all stages of the product cycle

We create **simple**, **well considered experiences**, frequently incorporating **user feedback**

We have **inclusive processes** that create **accessible products**

We build products that **deliver value**, **solve real problems**, and are a **delight to use**
