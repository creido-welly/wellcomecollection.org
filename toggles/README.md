# Weco Toggles

We currently use [Unlesash](https://github.com/Unleash/unleash) to manage our
feature toggles.

The code is currently in
[another repo](https://github.com/wellcometrust/feature-flags) to make it
easier to deploy from Heroku.

The API is currently hosted under https://weco-feature-flags.herokuapp.com.

# TODO
- [ ] Move code over to this repo
- [ ] Move service over to AWS
- [ ] Serve from toggles.wellcomecollection.org
