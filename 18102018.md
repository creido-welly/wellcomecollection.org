More formal than casual

3.
Slightly yes, my wife has mentioned it to nme

4.
I don't honestly remember what she told mentioned
Think it has to do with museums and collections of artifacts


5.
I like football matches - one team, one of the two - tottenham...
I like going to football, jetter
Local politics
I do go to museums
Bit of both, exhibitions and events, military history, military museums


6.
Season ticket for tottenham
Season ticket for many years


7.
I get email from strange and woderful places.
Signed up to email.
(Hayley): Googling topics?
Things in the paper, national press that interest me.


8.
Times and dates, and if I have to book, I'll book it.


9.
I usually use my desktop


11.
The fact you have it on the screen, I would use that, but otherwise I would
google

(history problems)

I would be looking for exhibitions, I would assume that the first one is the one
she told me about - so just click on that.



12.
little bit of information, time dates, some information about what's it's actually about



13.
Timings, location, if I know where the location, I wouldn't bother, just the
timings.


14.
It's got the dates on the promos, but I would need the times
Click through.
(arrow problem)
This is telling you what it's all about (on the body of the exhibitions)
First thing I would be looking for is the timings, not the tour.
(Still hasn't found the timings.)
I can't see where it needs a ticket, I would try to find out if I do
(looking at events) - odoesn't mention that I need a ticket
(scroll down) -  ah, it says it's free here (yellow box).
I would be looking for a map. If I scroll down will I see one?
I would really like to see a map. Busses, I would rally like to see a map.


(deviate from script)
looking for map, normally look for homepage or contact us.
I would definitely look at the homepage or to get a postcode


15.
It looks like it's going to be ineresting as it's going to be artistic.
Looks like models and plans based on the image




17.
Images fo whats's actuall there to be screen
I was expecting... some of it is, I can\t actually figure out what that is.
Ah, it says more in the caption... that would be interesting, talks about London
Hospital... Looking at that I can actually see what that is (looking at staircase photo)

It all looks very clear, with all the little things that it's telling me (captions)
Very cear and informative - the writing or description could be a little bit bolder.
Not everyone has amazing eyesite, I actually take my glasses (talking about caption text)
Needs to be a bit bolder


18.


19.
It will enthuse people to come have a look, the more inforamtion you can give
people the better.


20.
(asks about amount of images)
It's not too much it's not too little... would have thought it would be 10 to be even,
but that's being picky. 11 isn't a problem.

22.
It's more information about whats it's about - which is very good.
More information about what's available.
I do like the boldness of it.
It's black basically on a white background, which is brilliant.


24.
I would expect to click onto something.
From the picture, it looks like a lot of shelving.
If I read about it I would find out more.
Basically it's someone setting up mobile mediacal clinics

I can't relate to it being related to the exhibition.
Not to him, the exhibition looked like an art exhibition.


25.


26.
I thought you would be directed to it in a special designated area.
I think the logo should be a red cross.
A seperate area with directions.
I don't see the correlation between this and the art work, you can sign post it



27.
Normally go the back button!


29.
It's a tour of somesort of building, that takes place around the world
It's a tour of buildings that are buildt for specific purposes


30.
Anyone that pays a visit to the museum.
There may be people with more interest in morespecific buildings.


32.
Go to google and google past exhibitions.
I know where google is on my computer.
(new tab)
(googles: past exhibitions at wellcome)
Scroll down the page to look for past (the result isn't there)

I might ring up, it's generational.
because I've been in (inaudbile) around the world, it hasn't left me yet to speak to someone.

Word past wasn't there.

(seen "now on", probably not that one)

I'd hopefully know what the date wa
(Hayley tell him the date by pretending to be his friend)

Hayley: What are you focussing on
If it's a past exhibition, and I knew the dates, I would be looking at the dates

It was my birthday that one.

33.
Wow! (at the graphic).
An ancient medicine. It also looks like it's written in an ancient language.
So it's obviously I think where a lot of body part names came from.
Ancient medicine and what they new about in those days.
Looks like an interesting exhibition
It's just giving you a history of it.
Down to exhibition highlights...

If you're looking at a past exhibition, I would expect to see what was there,
and some more information

34.
Yes, because I am interested in military history.
So if there was something I was researching, and missed the exhibition, I would
definitely go back and look.
I think looking back at past exhibitions, I think, as a student, it would be
useful to knwo what was available, useful for research.
Bolder captions
thoguht that might have been the end (end of image gallery)


36.
I would expect it to be pictures of the brain as it's in the mind... hold up,
I'm not sure, I don't really know, I'd click through to se what was there.

It's telling me, basically, what the tongs...(tails off)

It's telling you what these things look like.
Personally I would have the picture first as I had to read and then see what I was reading about.
"What are they talking about" and then I see it.

(would you expect this on a museum content)
Yes, absolutely.
