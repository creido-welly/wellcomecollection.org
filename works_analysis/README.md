# works_analysis

This directory contains some scripts for analysing the types of Work in the Library Collection, to help the Experience team make better product design decisions.

## Usage

These scripts should run in Python 2 or Python 3, including the built-in OS X Python.

First you should save a local copy of the data; this makes subsequent scripts much faster:

```console
$ python download_data.py
```
