# Prismic Remapper

To remap you content, export the documents from Prismic, dump it into `./.dist`.

Create the filter and remapper that you'd like, create a new folder for it, and
stick the remapper at `./<ACTION>/remap.js`.

Remappers should export a `map` and `filter` function, both of which take the
document as their primary argument.

The new documents will be stored in `.dist/remapped`.

  yarn remap <FILTER_AND_MAPPER_NAME>

# TODO
* Batch sizing (we don't have enough content for this to be an issue).
