But today, most of our tin comes from Central Africa, especially the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The huge amounts of money involved, said Andrea, are fueling civil war in the DRC. Perhaps, therefore, we should be rethinking this relationship with tin.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"You can see the full playlist of Elements films, including last year’s, on this <a title=\"Elements YouTube Playlist\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL30AF949EAA239699\">YouTube playlist</a>.
