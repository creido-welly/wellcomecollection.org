Pettenkofer did not deny the existence of the bacterium, but he insisted that without the right environmental conditions it would not cause cholera. And he was willing to put his life at stake to show that he was right: in 1893, aged 74, he received a sample of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> from Koch’s lab and drank it in front of a group of colleagues.
