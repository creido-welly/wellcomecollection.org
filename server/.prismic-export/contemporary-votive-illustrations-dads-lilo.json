The tide appeared to be going out again very quickly while we were playing on the lilo. My father took his turn on the lilo, and my sister and I found that we were very quickly out of our depth. We couldn’t reach him, and he sat frozen with fear on the lilo. In a panic, we both ran back to the beach to tell our mother and others on the beach. Some of them tried to swim out to reach him, but he was out too far. Eventually, someone called a lifeboat, which appeared like a vision across the sea. It moved gently towards my father and the lifeguards lifted him onto the boat. When it reached the shore, my father was pale, speechless and shaking. He was given a sugary cup of milky tea. We were all shocked but so relieved and grateful that he was back with us.","spans":[]}}],"source":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":null,"spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<em>You can <a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/exhibitions/infinitas-gracias/inspired-by-your-stories/about-the-illustrators/marta-wawryszuk.aspx\">find out more about Marta Wawryszuk’s work</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/exhibitions/infinitas-gracias/inspired-by-your-stories.aspx\">explore more votive illustrations</a> on the Wellcome Collection website.</em>","spans":[]}}]}}}]}
