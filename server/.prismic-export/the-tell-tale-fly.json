The usual suspects were present, but Lindgren also noted four unusual insect–cadaver interactions that had never been documented before – including a scorpionfly feeding on brain fluids through an autopsy wound in the scalp and a worm, previously only known to feed on decaying wood, feeding on the dried skin around where the toenails had been.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Insects colonise a cadaver in successive waves, and each has its own unique life cycle.

Time-of-death estimates based on the age of blowfly maggots found on a body are based on the assumption that blowflies colonised the cadaver right after death, but this isn’t always the case: burial can exclude insects, for example, and extreme temperatures inhibit their growth or prevent it altogether. Even if insects appear just after death, they are cold-blooded creatures, so their rate of growth is relative to temperature rather than to the calendar. If you know the temperature and the growth cycle of a fly, you can estimate its age to within an hour or two, says Bucheli – but if not, time-of-death estimates based on insect colonisation can be wildly inaccurate and misleading.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"An earlier study led by Lindgren revealed another unusual way in which blowflies might be prevented from laying eggs on a cadaver. “We made a post-mortem wound to the stomach [of a donated body] then partially buried the cadaver in a shallow grave,” says Bucheli, “but fire ants made little sponges out of dirt and used them to fill in the cut and stop up the fluid.” The ants monopolised the wound for more than a week, and then it rained. “This washed the dirt sponges out.
