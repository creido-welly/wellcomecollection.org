Its electrical conductivity in particular has been central to our systems for transmitting information, done through copper wires. This property, said Andrea, really transformed the world in the 19th Century following the work of <a title=\"Charles Wheatstone and telegraphy on wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wheatstone#Telegraph\">Charles Wheatstone</a> in the area of telegraphy.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"It also makes really great cookware, because of its thermal conductivity. Andrea has a lovely copper pan which you can see early on in the film, but using copper directly with food can result in the food having a slightly metallic tan. We had a go at filming the tinning process necessary to coat the copper and stop this transferring to the food, but, ah, it didn’t go very well so that didn’t make the cut!","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Hope you enjoy the event tonight.
