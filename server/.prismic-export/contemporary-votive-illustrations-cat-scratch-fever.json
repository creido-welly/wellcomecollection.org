She also complained of pain in her neck behind her ears. The doctors discovered there were sacs of pus behind her ears, but the cause was mysterious. They kept draining them, and they kept coming back. Her fevers continued, she grew weaker and weaker. It was a mystery. My mother prayed, and lit prayers to our Saints every day, mostly St Jude. One doctor finally discovered she had an illness called ‘cat scratch fever’, a very rare illness. The doctors were then able to heal her, and today she is 17 years old. I don’t believe that she would have survived if not for God and the Saints hearing our prayers.","spans":[]}}],"source":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":null,"spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<em>You can <a href=\"http://vm-obsidian:8081/whats-on/exhibitions/infinitas-gracias/inspired-by-your-stories/about-the-illustrators/kinga-szczypi%C5%84ska.aspx\">find out more about Kinga Szczypińska’s work</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/exhibitions/infinitas-gracias/inspired-by-your-stories.aspx\">explore more votive illustrations</a> on the Wellcome Collection website.</em>","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<em><a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/exhibitions/infinitas-gracias/inspired-by-your-stories/inspire-a-votive.aspx\">Could your gratitude inspire a votive</a>?
