It travels from crime scene to courtroom, across centuries and continents, drawing out the stories of victims, suspects and investigators of violent crimes. One of such story is that of the Chilean women who sift through the sand of the Atacama desert searching for evidence of the bodies of their loved ones: political prisoners held in concentration camps run during Pinochet’s dictatorship. Their enduring efforts have equipped them with skills more typically associated with forensic experts.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Their story is told in a short, six minute clip from Patricio Guzman’s <a href=\"http://www.rmg.co.uk/whats-on/events/nostalgia-for-the-light\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Nostalgia for the Light</span></a> (Nostalgia de la luz) film, a profound and searching cinematic essay set in Chile’s Atacama desert. In the film, Guzman explores different ways of looking, from the women who are now able to identify minute shard of bone amid the mass of rocks and dust in this vast, unforgiving landscape, to the astronomers who work alongside them in the Atacama desert, gazing into their astral telescopes, into the deep time of stellar origins.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"embeddedImage","value":{"non-repeat":{"caption":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Stills from Unseen, at Royal Museums Greenwich.","spans":[]}}],"image":{"origin":{"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/unseen.jpg","width":965,"height":768},"width":965,"height":768,"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/unseen.jpg","edit":{"background":"transparent","zoom":1,"crop":{"x":0,"y":0}},"alt":"Unseen, at Royal Museums Greenwich.","thumbnails":{}},"weight":"default"}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"With the support of the Wellcome Trust, Royal Museums Greenwich have also been exploring the role of looking in our free <a href=\"http://www.rmg.co.uk/whats-on/events/unseen-dryden-goodwin\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Unseen: The Lives of Looking</span></a> by Dryden Goodwin exhibition at the Queen’s House.
