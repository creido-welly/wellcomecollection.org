In a culture where death is taboo and  art about dying is scarce or considered morbid, there are few continuing visual  traditions surrounding ‘a good death’. I investigated art from the past in  the Wellcome Collection’s library and was impressed with the delicacy and beauty  of the object created in response to such a dark and difficult subject.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<a title=\"http://www.sobellhospiceoxford.org/\" href=\"http://www.sobellhospiceoxford.org/\" target=\"_self\">Sobell House </a>Hospice  and its patients kindly allowed me to draw them during January and February  2011. Although it cares for patients who need more medical attention than would  be possible in their own homes, Sobell allows patients, their families and  friends to create their own environments, altering them as much or as little as  they desire and circumstances allow. It also encourages facing dying through  creativity in the form of music, art or religious contemplation. At Sobell,  patients are allowed to create their own Ars Moriendi – their personal art of  dying.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"embeddedImage","value":{"non-repeat":{"caption":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Music Therapy","spans":[]}}],"image":{"origin":{"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/musictherapycropped.jpg","width":450,"height":338},"width":450,"height":338,"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/musictherapycropped.jpg","edit":{"background":"transparent","zoom":1,"crop":{"x":0,"y":0}},"alt":"Music Therapy","thumbnails":{}},"weight":"default"}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Never having been in one before, I felt pretty nervous the first time I  visited the hospice and I had two meetings with staff and managers before I  started to draw.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"One of them told me, “You’ll get a lot of different reactions.
