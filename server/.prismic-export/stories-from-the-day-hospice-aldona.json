As we chatted about which person she would like to think about for an exercise in the writing group, the story below started to form. I transcribed her speech and read it back to her. Aldona spoke with great fondness of her mother, recalling her beautiful soprano voice, her red hair and even the perfume she wore (<i>Chypre</i> by Coty).","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"This piece finishes with Aldona saying how her imagination was affected by the war.
