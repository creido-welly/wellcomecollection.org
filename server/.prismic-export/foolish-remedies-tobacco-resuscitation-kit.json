A theory put together by the ancient Greeks and Romans who&nbsp;considered that good health was maintained&nbsp;via the correct balance between our bodily fluids: blood, phlegm, black bile and yellow bile. It may seem hard to believe that a practice such as bloodletting survived until the 19th century based on this theory, but various other medical devices have been developed in an effort to address the balance of the four humors.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"embeddedImage","value":{"non-repeat":{"caption":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Resuscitation set, 1801-1850.","spans":[]}}],"image":{"origin":{"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/7d1c3f7ea1b306224986395d4224.jpg","width":800,"height":559},"width":800,"height":559,"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/7d1c3f7ea1b306224986395d4224.jpg","edit":{"background":"transparent","zoom":1,"crop":{"x":0,"y":0}},"alt":"Resuscitation set, 1801-1850.","thumbnails":{}},"weight":"default"}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"My personal favourite is the tobacco resuscitator kit (above) usually displayed in our <a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/exhibitions/medicine-man.aspx\">Medicine Man</a> gallery.

Swimming was not a popular sport in Georgian London and, in 1773, 123 people died from drowning in London. Hawes and Cogan believed that if they had administered a quick and effective treatment, some of the victims would have been brought back to life. Since the theory of the four humors was still widely spread and commonly accepted at the time, they based their observations on it: drowned people have an excess of wet and cold in their humors so a rational way to cure them, 18th century style, was to quickly reestablish the balance by introducing warmth and administering stimulating vapors, such as tobacco, into the body.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"embeddedImage","value":{"non-repeat":{"caption":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"A man recuperating in bed at a receiving-house of the Royal Humane Society, after resuscitation by William Hawes from near drowning.","spans":[]}}],"image":{"origin":{"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/aca574fa4d32bfeefb18e574a759.jpg","width":689,"height":576},"width":689,"height":576,"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/aca574fa4d32bfeefb18e574a759.jpg","edit":{"background":"transparent","zoom":1,"crop":{"x":0,"y":0}},"alt":"A man recuperating in bed at a receiving-house of the Royal Humane Society, after resuscitation by W.
