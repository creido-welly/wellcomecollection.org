In a letter to his brother Theo, written in September 1888, Van Gogh explained: “Ah well, if we made the colour very correct or the drawing very correct, we wouldn’t create those emotions.”[1] Simply put: he painted how he felt, not how he saw, which was far too intense for most people to handle at the time. His biography, most notably his illness, overshadows how we see his art today. Although he has been endlessly diagnosed both during his lifetime and posthumously, the general consensus today is that the artist suffered from severe bipolar disorder. His intense, personal, emotional states are apparent in his works yet the works themselves are universal, conveying the complexity of our human experience.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Van Gogh came to Gachet’s practice after spending a year in an asylum in Saint-Rémy, in the south of France.

Van Gogh described the work to his friend Paul Gauguin as “a portrait of Dr Gachet with the deeply sad expression of our time.”[4] Gachet and Van Gogh printed the plate together that afternoon.
