However, I survived, with reasonable health so far. I feel an enormous sense of gratitude that I live in this day and age, when I can obtain spectacles (all my life), medication for chronic problems (thyroid and migraine) and surgery for muscle damage with relative ease. Without these things, I would be half-blind and very ill or disabled most of the time, if I were even alive. I also have a good house to live in, and enough money to buy food and fuel. I don’t believe in any God, but I give thanks for the great things in my life, and try to do some things which help others who are less fortunate.
