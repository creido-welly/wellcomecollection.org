This particular mummy, nicknamed Ötzi, has been extensively studied and&nbsp;scanned. To date, over sixty tattoos have been identified on his body. Consisting of simple line-work, it was initially thought these may be stylised art or symbols. Closer inspection does not support the idea of decoration: being situated on likely areas of pain such as the lumbar spine, wrist and hip suggests that the tattoos may have been therapeutic. Indeed, the scans have confirmed that Ötzi had osteoarthritis and other old wounds in these areas.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Just like Maori tradition, perhaps Ötzi’s lines and dashes are part of a belief system.

With so many individual tattoos, Oetzi seemingly trusted in their power to heal. Whether he&nbsp;realised that there might have been&nbsp;more to it than his belief alone, we don’t know.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<em>Rock is a Visitor Experience Assistant at Wellcome Collection.</em>","spans":[]}}]}}}]}
