My brief was so open that once the theme was approved I was free to give the event the shape I wanted, which is surely the best position to be in creatively.&nbsp; With licence to watch films, trawl archives and have conversations that would normally be outside of my artistic sphere, it was the material and the people I encountered at Wellcome Collection that really gave ‘Quacks’ its form.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"I wanted to have a strong visual identity for the event, which gave me an excuse to indulge my interest in ephemera and satirical images. <a href=\"http://images.wellcome.ac.uk/\">Wellcome Images</a> made me stunning reproductions of 18th- and 19th-century posters for <a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/explore/sickness--health/topics/tonics-and-curatives.aspx\">dubious remedies</a>, and images by the artists who mercilessly lampooned the medical profession of their day, much as the cartoonist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/stevebell\">Steve Bell</a> might humiliate our current political leaders.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"I’ve also been able to experiment with performance as a way of presenting the more theatrical elements of the medical profession.
