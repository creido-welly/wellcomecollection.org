There are often unexpected revelations that come up along the way.

It’s fascinating to get an insight into this process.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"The work of the Trust in creating art/science collaborations was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2011/aug/21/collaborations-between-artists-and-scientists\">highlighted in an article in The Guardian</a> at the weekend. It mentions some projects that we’ve funded and others too.
