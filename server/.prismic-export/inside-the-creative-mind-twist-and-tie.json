The ordinariness of the material, the inventiveness and the sheer numbers (like humans, each one unique) were an inspiration.

So we simply wrote our names in joined-up writing, first on paper and then by manipulating the twist ties.

There is an element of surprise at the pleasure derived from manipulating the most ordinary of materials and transforming them into something new. ‘E’ commented that it was a bit like taking the top of a champagne bottle and making it into a chair. ‘A’ said she knew someone who made ‘chairs’ out of the labels on bread bags. </span>","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<span>The final task was a little more complicated and involved a weaving technique that soon turned into carpets and coasters. ‘A’ commented that we are “losing some of our skills these days, like how to sew on a button.
