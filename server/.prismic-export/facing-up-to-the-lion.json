This discussion and openness, both on and offline, seems to me to be at least as important as the finished opera itself. We often discuss how science and art can come together with reference only to a finished work: we don’t see the learning process, the false starts, the changes of focus, the development of an idea. For allowing us an insight into this, we owe The Opera Group a great deal.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"youtubeVideo","value":{"non-repeat":{"embed":{"type":"video","embed_url":"https://youtube.com/watch?v=SwO0C22Svrw"}}}}]}
