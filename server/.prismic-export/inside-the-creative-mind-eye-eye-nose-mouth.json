It was a challenge; admittedly, it is hard, but a surprising number of people are stuck in notions of “I can’t draw” or “I don’t know where to start!” I didn’t want the girls to be afraid of making some marks on a piece of paper.

The work, which had started with one or two airbrushed faces, got increasingly interesting as new and odd parts were glued on. At one point I highlighted the <a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/exhibitions/souzou/360-degree-objects/hideaki-yoshikawa.aspx\">work of artist Hideaki Yoshikawa</a>,&nbsp;who ‘dissects and abstracts the features of the human face’ in his ceramic series Eye, eye, nose, mouth.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"A&nbsp;final part of the exercise introduced a further layer by taking another image (and the brown paper instructions from old sewing patterns) and hole punching.
