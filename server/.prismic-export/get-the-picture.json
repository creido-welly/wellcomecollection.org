It may be what inspired a new generation of artists in the 1990s to include the public in their productions; a movement called relational art. In the past few decades, artists have tried to bring down the boundaries between art, museums and visitors. The controversial artist Michael Landy, whose work is exhibited in our Medicine Now gallery, succeeded in that attempt in his latest exhibition <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/michael-landy-saints-alive\" target=\"_blank\">Saints Alive at the National Gallery</a>. Inspired by the museum’s collection, Landy created gigantic sculptures between 10 and 12 feet tall, which were put into motion by visitor participation. The exhibition only really happens thanks to the public animating the figures.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Another artist actively encouraging the audience to take part in her work is <a href=\"http://www.alice-anderson.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Alice Anderson</a>.

Six artist residencies were set up in Wellcome Trust funded research centres around the globe: Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Thailand, Vietnam and the UK. The artists spent six months in their residencies exploring the medical research carried out, from the points of view of both the scientists and the local community.

Pata Picha means ‘get the picture’ in Swahili. James and Miriam spent their residency in Kenya exploring the dynamic between the researchers and the “researched on”; investigating how each community perceives and works with the other. They met with scientists from the <a href=\"http://www.kemri.org/\" target=\"_blank\">KEMRI</a> (Kenya Medical Research Institute) as well as members of the local community. Through these conversations they identified education, belief, context, exploration and money &amp; power to be important elements of the health research and aspects that influence the relationship between the two groups. The Pata Picha studio is a visual representation of these findings. Members of the community were invited to come into the studio to have their picture taken with items that represent all five areas identified by Miriam’s and James’ research, including altered lab coats. The aim was for the local community to explore the scientists’ world and for each to step out of their routine to create a better understanding of each other’s communities.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Until March 16, the Pata Picha studio is at Wellcome Collection offering visitors the opportunity to step into an art installation, explore another side of medical research and have their picture taken and printed on the spot (free of charge) to take away as a souvenir.
