Eyes in the backs of our heads?”","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"I encouraged everyone to get stuck in with some red clay in hand. The only restriction I placed on it was scale, that each object could not exceed the amount of clay given.&nbsp; This is something I have discovered through running the workshops; by limiting the scale it has proved less threatening to participants and allowed those in the group who feel that “I am not an artist” and “I can’t do art” to simply have a go.&nbsp; Tactile materials become a pleasure to work with; A talked about how she liked “playing with blu-tac – I cant help myself, I’ve just got to fiddle with it”.&nbsp; There is a compulsion to pull and stretch it and even craft something out of it.&nbsp; Without exception small objects emerged from everyone’s red clay.&nbsp; H produces a medley of individual body parts that she then places in a small “sad” pile.&nbsp; M makes an eye in relief and V comments that it is reminiscent of the small votives in the Wellcome Collection.&nbsp; Interestingly some of the girls who struggled initially came up with some really evocative objects.&nbsp; H just bashed away at the clay, making marks and venting something..","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"So, two things from today – the nostalgic enjoyment of a tactile material and the non-threatening nature of working at small scale. It feels like the last six weeks have been enormously fruitful, not least for myself as an artist.&nbsp; I cannot over estimate the inspiration drawn from the Souzou exhibition.&nbsp; The work there is liberated from constraint and encourages us to embrace a child-like delight – one that revels in mark making, the feel of a material, drawing on fantasy and imagination.&nbsp; I have loved seeing the group participants become calm and focused, relaxed and chatting with hands and brains busy.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"What a wonderful thing art is!","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<em></em><em><a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/exhibitions/japanese-outsider-art.aspx\">Souzou</a> runs until Sunday 30 June.
