The team find willing volunteers amongst patients who are already undergoing procedures on their heart. These patients have a catheter – a thin plastic tube, with a platinum end – leading from the upper leg, through a vein into a chamber of the heart. This platinum ended catheter can measure the electrical activity of the heart, and therefore if it is beating normally. Finlay brought along a catheter to show the audience, and I have to say it was a lot bigger than expected. He explained that veins don’t contain any nerves, and are extremely stretchy, so the patient doesn’t feel any pain at all.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"To get the patients stressed, he first has to relax them.

This can cause serious damage, particularly in these patients who already have heart problems.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"The research aims to find out how and why our hearts react the way they do to these situations. Finlay wants to find out the mechanism of how the heart responds to stress, so it can be treated accordingly, rather than just treating symptoms. The research is still in its early days, but he has already seen more results than he thought. You never know, one day he could even find a cure for a broken heart.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<em>Nancy Wilkinson is a graduate trainee at the Wellcome Trust.</em>","spans":[]}}]}}}]}
