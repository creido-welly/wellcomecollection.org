A million copies would overwhelm our bodies and kill us (as probably happened in the 1918 flu pandemic), effectively making the virus ‘homeless’.&nbsp;The most successful viruses are ‘silent’ and cause few symptoms in the host, like those living in wild waterfowl or the numerous viruses all of us humans harbour but are unaware of because they don’t make us ill&nbsp;–&nbsp;the herpes virus, for example.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Our bodies compromise in turn.
