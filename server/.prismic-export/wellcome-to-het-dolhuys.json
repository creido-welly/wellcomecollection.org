This is clearly problematic, especially as there are well-known artists who have not had any training but are not considered outsider artists. Equally there are artists who have experience of mental health problems that wouldn’t feature in an outsider art exhibition.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"I am therefore looking forward to seeing how the Het Dolhuys has presented Japanese outsider art.
