Selected films were back-projected from the rear of a cinemotor van (in the first instance a converted disinfection van) as well as other public locations such as schools, clubs and other institutions. The cinemotor appears at the end of the film. Evidence suggests that their reception was at times rowdy: the vans were gaily painted and children would cheer at each slide.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"The catchy intertitles encouraged audience participation; <em><a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/exhibitions/here-comes-good-health/films.aspx?view=where-theres-life\">Where there’s life, there’s soap</a></em>(1933) was written in poetic doggerel and was all about the benefits of good versus bad personal hygiene. According to the annual Ministry of Health report for Bermondsey of 1937, the films held by the borough had an audience of 42 464 people that year (the 1931 census put the total population at 111 000 inhabitants). The same films were shown repeatedly and became a familiar fixture to many local people.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Health propaganda in terms of education and general awareness was considered to be key in moderating bad and promoting good health.

At a time when universal healthcare was exceptional, Bermondsey offered the hard-working population engaged in its dockyards and factories &nbsp;maternity welfare, dental surgeries, a solarium (artificial sunlight treatment), a tuberculosis dispensary and a foot clinic. These are all shown in session in the film. Other amenities such as regular refuse collection are presented as well as an electricity showroom which extolled the virtues of ‘clean’ energy with the demonstration of vacuum cleaners and electric cookers available for hire.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"This genre of film-making is explored in greater depth by Elizabeth Lebas in her book which surveys municipal film, <a href=\"http://blackdogonline.com/all-books/forgotten-futures.html\">Forgotten Futures: British Municipal Cinema 1920-1980</a>. There is a chapter devoted to Bermondsey, “<em>When Every Street Became a Cinema”</em>. Lebas describes &nbsp;the&nbsp; prevailing ideology as “missionary as well as socialist”; the Public Health Department was staffed by social visionaries and also very ‘hands-on’ men and women. Indeed, rather than hire a professional, commercial organisation to script and shoot, resident radiographer, Mr C. F. Lumley took the role of cameraman in a number of films.
