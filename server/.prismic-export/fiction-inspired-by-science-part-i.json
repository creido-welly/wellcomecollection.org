What are you actually <em>doing</em>? they ask. They assume I am reporting in some way on what goes on, or helping the scientists to write. They don’t imagine – especially if they are scientists themselves – that I am writing fiction inspired by being in the labs. When I explain this, if it is a scientist I am talking to, a funny look comes over their face. But what we do is mostly boring, they say. Oh no, I say. You have no idea – every little thing in the lab is fascinating to me, from the purple latex gloves to the sandwiches people eat in lab meetings. It’s a different world.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"If you Google ‘<a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22fiction+inspired+by+science%22\">fiction inspired by science</a>‘ many of the results you will find are actually science inspired by fiction, or science inspired by science fiction. But there is a growing field of short stories, novels and poetry that is inspired in some way by scientific research or by life in the laboratory, or by the history of science or the language of science. Some of it is called Lab Lit (there is a great website, <a href=\"http://www.lablit.com/\">LabLit.com</a>, which publishes and discusses this ‘genre’). Maybe we could call it all SciLit, instead of the more unwieldy ‘science-inspired fiction’.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"SciArt is a well-known term, but often it seems to refer only to the visual arts, such as in Stephen Wilson’s fabulous new book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Science-Now-technological-21st-century/dp/0500238685\">Art+Science Now</a>. This must be, I assume, because fiction inspired by science is thought to be science fiction – although science fiction is not necessarily inspired by science. And science fiction isn’t considered ‘art’ by this world, but that’s another blog post.&nbsp; I don’t think I write science fiction. I have only recently begun to read science fiction, and although I’m finding much to enjoy, I am not sure aficionados would consider what I do to fit in there.

I trained as a journalist and spent 13 years writing about science and technology. But fiction was my other first love. I started by taking inspiration from <em>reports</em> of science: half the stories in my first book, <a href=\"http://www.taniahershman.com/thewhiteroad.htm\">The White Road and Other Stories</a>, took articles from New Scientist as their starting point, and then my imagination took over.

Or chick-lit novels or blockbuster films? Yes, there is <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/\">The Big Bang Theory</a>, which I do love (an am not embarrassed to admit that I get many of the physics jokes) but I would argue that this does little to dispel the myth of the scientist as a genius barely functioning in society! We have all manner of fiction set in workplaces, from lawyers’ offices to the emergency room, so why not the lab? No wonder there are so many misconceptions about what scientists do and what science is (it’s about hard facts, black and white, being right or wrong…), because knowing what goes on in laboratories is not part of our everyday, unless that’s where we work.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Real laboratories are peopled by a wonderful and varied mix of researchers, often from around the globe, of all shapes and sizes, all temperaments and personalities, just like in other workplaces. In real laboratories, things often go wrong, preparing experiments and carrying them out takes a long, long time, and it is this that I am interested in. I like to make things up, so while I am taking notes on my days in the biochemistry lab, they are more about how the researchers use language to talk about their work, to talk to each other, and what the rhythms of life are in a lab than writing down whole scenes which I will then transpose into fiction.
