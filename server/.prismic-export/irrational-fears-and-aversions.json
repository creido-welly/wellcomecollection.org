Throughout <a href=\"http://storify.com/ExploreWellcome/what-are-your-irrational-fears\" target=\"_blank\">all of these responses</a>, a few predominant aversive emotions shone through that are often found tied to irrational fears: anxiety, hatred, horror and disgust.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"This observation is nothing new.

Whereas the cause of a love of balloons is usually clear and rational (such as a happy memory or aesthetic pleasure), the reason to fear them is irrational and harder to grasp. What’s more, these irrational aversions are not focused only on their central object; they also affect related behaviour.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"By way of an example, one of the tweets particularly caught my attention. @charlottelb tweeted:","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"twitterEmbed","value":{"non-repeat":{"embed":{"type":"video","embed_url":"https://twitter.com/charlottelb/status/433235173959041024"}}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"This phobia is the reason I became interested in aversive emotions in the first place. My wife has lived with Emetophobia for some time (now controlled through <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy\" target=\"_blank\">CBT</a>) and her phobia was not fear alone: it was a mixture of aversive emotions. The most powerful was the combination of two whose links to phobias are becoming increasingly well documented: anxiety and disgust. Vomiting is an abomination to almost everybody as it combines many causes of disgust, such as the ejection of what is supposed to be contained within the body the wrong way through a bodily orifice of a substance that is putrefied; foul tasting; and able to remind us of our animal existence and mortality.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"embeddedImage","value":{"non-repeat":{"caption":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Rob Bidder’s #CuriousConversations illustration, Irrationals Fears: First Batch.","spans":[]}}],"image":{"origin":{"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/fear-1.jpg","width":2478,"height":1793},"width":2478,"height":1793,"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/fear-1.jpg","edit":{"background":"transparent","zoom":1,"crop":{"x":0,"y":0}},"alt":"Rob Bidder's #CuriousConversations illustration, Irrationals Fears: First Batch.","thumbnails":{}},"weight":"default"}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"The phobia stems, as do many phobias, from contamination anxiety.
