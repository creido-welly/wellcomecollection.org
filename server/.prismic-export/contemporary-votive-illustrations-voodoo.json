Nothing seemed to work. I went to New Orleans and purchased a candle of the Voodoo goddess Sirene Baleine in a tacky vodoo shop. I kept it on my shelf for a while. I also bought a plastic glow-in-the dark San Gregorio when I was in Colombia. He is depicted wearing a white Edwardian suit and Clark Gable mustache. He is supposed to be a healing saint but I enjoyed its unusual shape and glow-in-the-dark qualities. Half playing, half hoping, one day I decided to make a little ritual to both divinities. I gave a dried out sea horse that I inherited from my father to the Sirene Baleine and a flower and a sugared almond from my wedding to San Gregorio and lit the voodoo candle. Three weeks later I was pregnant.","spans":[]}}],"source":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":null,"spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<em>You can <a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/exhibitions/infinitas-gracias/inspired-by-your-stories/about-the-illustrators/marta-wawryszuk.aspx\">find out more about Marta Wawryszuk’s work</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/exhibitions/infinitas-gracias/inspired-by-your-stories.aspx\">explore more votive illustrations</a> on the Wellcome Collection website.</em>","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<em><a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/exhibitions/infinitas-gracias/inspired-by-your-stories/inspire-a-votive.aspx\">Could your gratitude inspire a votive</a>?
