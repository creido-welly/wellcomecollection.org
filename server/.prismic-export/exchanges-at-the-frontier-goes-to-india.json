After a snack of samosas and Indian sweets on the lawn, the 250-strong audience of local schoolchildren, members of the public and PRL researchers packed the auditorium to hear Professor Goswami talk to the BBC’s Justin Rowlatt about the importance of the Mars mission for Indian’s scientific status and national pride. It was perhaps the liveliest audience we’ve ever seen for Exchanges at the Frontier, given to bursting into spontaneous applause and laughter, and eagerly asking questions of our speaker on topics ranging from the technical challenges of the mission to the likelihood of finding aliens on Mars. Given that the subject is of such significance and interest to Indian people, it felt entirely appropriate to be holding the event on home turf, where the garrulous enthusiasm for science and support for India’s ambitious space programme created a brilliant atmosphere in the room. During the event Goswami spoke not just about the scientific details of the mission, but about his own early experiences as a budding scientist. He reminisced about his first encounter with space – lying on the grass as a child in his home state of Assam, looking out for Sputnik as it passed overhead. It seems likely that for some of the young people in the audience, India’s Mars mission may prove to be a similarly inspirational first step in their own scientific careers.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"You can listen to the programme <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01kdgsy\">on the BBC World Service website</a>.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"For information on upcoming events and to book, visit <a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/exchanges\">the Wellcome Collection website</a>.","spans":[]}}]}}}]}
