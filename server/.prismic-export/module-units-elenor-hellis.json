It was interesting to see how young artists at different stages of their artistic education interacted and responded to each other’s work. I liked the surprise element of the project where no one was 100% sure of what we were all going to make and the mystery of whether our pieces were going to work alongside each other. I think the final result was quite interesting. I had slight concerns as to how my younger peers (and their parents) were going to respond to my work, as I was dealing with quite mature and personal themes. Overall, I had quite a positive and mature response to my work and I think the output of work from others was very impressive.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"embeddedImage","value":{"non-repeat":{"caption":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"","spans":[]}}],"image":{"origin":{"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/elenor-3.png","width":500,"height":313},"width":500,"height":313,"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/elenor-3.png","edit":{"background":"transparent","zoom":1,"crop":{"x":0,"y":0}},"alt":"Elenor 3","thumbnails":{}},"weight":"default"}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"It was interesting seeing the work altogether in the room.
