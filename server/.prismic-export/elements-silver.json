Andrea has an interest in glassware and its history, and this is his favourite piece. Towards the end of the 19th century, physicists were working on liquifying air and needed some means of storing this very cold liquid for long periods. This container would require really good insulation. James Dewar, who was working at the Royal Institution, came up with the solution that would become known as a Dewar flask.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"embeddedImage","value":{"non-repeat":{"caption":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Andrea Sella with a silver-lined Dewar flask","spans":[]}}],"image":{"origin":{"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/screen-shot-2012-06-19-at-10-03-17.png","width":1813,"height":1004},"width":1813,"height":1004,"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/screen-shot-2012-06-19-at-10-03-17.png","edit":{"background":"transparent","zoom":1,"crop":{"x":0,"y":0}},"alt":"Andrea Sella with a silver lined dewar flask","thumbnails":{}},"weight":"default"}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"The flask has an inner and outer ‘shell’ of glass, which have a vacuum between them that ensures that energy can’t be easily transmitted from the inside to the outside of the flask. But Dewar also used a technique that created a very thin layer of silver on the inside of the glass. It’s this that gives it the beautiful reflectiveness which helps to keep heat out. It is, as Andrea says, perfect double glazing.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"You can see the full playlist of Elements films, including last year’s, on this <a title=\"Elements YouTube Playlist\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL30AF949EAA239699\">YouTube playlist</a>.
