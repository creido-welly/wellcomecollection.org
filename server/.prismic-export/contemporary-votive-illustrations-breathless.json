I thought I was just out of shape and joined a gym&nbsp;– till eventually after almost collapsing there and having an echocardiogram, they discovered I had an irregular heartbeat, dilated cardiomyopathy (a stretched heart) and a big clot inside in that could break off and cause a heart attack or stroke. I was in hospital where my life hung in the balance for about three weeks, then when I came out I could hardly walk for months. I was getting ready to be disabled for the rest of my life, until doctors tried some new drugs and I could walk again. Now I have an internal cardiac defibrillator and have to take tablets every day to keep me alive, but I’m slowly improving and managed recently to walk Hadrian’s Wall (quite slowly)!","spans":[]}}],"source":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":null,"spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<em>You can <a href=\"http://vm-obsidian:8081/whats-on/exhibitions/infinitas-gracias/inspired-by-your-stories/about-the-illustrators/becki-hiscocks.aspx\">find out more about Becki Hiscocks’ work</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/exhibitions/infinitas-gracias/inspired-by-your-stories.aspx\">explore more votive illustrations</a> on the Wellcome Collection website.</em>","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<em><a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/exhibitions/infinitas-gracias/inspired-by-your-stories/inspire-a-votive.aspx\">Could your gratitude inspire a votive</a>?
