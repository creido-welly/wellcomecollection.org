Missing a certain something, deficient of it entirely: motion, movement &amp; time. They are not present. Now this lack, apparent in all photographs, is also their greatest strength, allowing the eye to linger on the wonderful complexity of a frozen moment that would pass too quickly to be perceived otherwise. Yet trying to convey a sense of movement in a still image has always required skillful manipulation of inferences such as posture and motion blur.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Light painting is entirely a creation of movement. A light source is drawn across the scene while the camera is open and so a single point creates a flowing line.

Lights attached to the performers’ bodies trace out the motion of their movement in a pitch dark environment while a final high speed flash freezes their final position. The nuances of their action are present in the trail, visual representation of motion and movement over time in a still image. Quite literally graphic data.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Science has always been of interest to me.
