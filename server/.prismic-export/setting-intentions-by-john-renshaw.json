Setting intentions in Tibetan Buddhism is similar, but there are differences: there is a common practice which can be done every day, several times a day or simply whenever&nbsp;you remember. The principle is already integrated into the practice. It’s typically at the beginning, when we take refuge and generate “bodhicitta”, or altruistic intension.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Depending on lineage or tradition we use different words: mantras, visualisations or mudras.

So there is no need for antidotes, there’s nothing to avoid, renounce or transform, because everything is already perfect.&nbsp;Why would I need to modify anything or set intentions?","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Well, it’s not so easy to be in this “perfect” state.

After observing ourselves we get to know our condition: our strengths, limitations and qualities.

In Tibetan Biddhism there is this metaphor used to understand this relationship: the mind is the lame rider and the blind horse represents our energy. If the horse is nervous and reactive, it may throw the rider; if the rider is dominant and not connected to the horse, our energy suffers. So the yogis practise equipoise and the integration of both.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"embeddedImage","value":{"non-repeat":{"caption":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"The Minor Connecting Blood Vessels.
