For Professor French it is the ‘psychology of the weird and wonderful’ and when asked what could be classified as such, examples of telepathy, life after death, feng shui, UFOs, reincarnation and angels made the cut. These beliefs can depend not only on personal sensibilities but can also be due to social and economic factors, such as where you live and what the beliefs of your nearest and dearest are.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"In Professor French’s typical experiment we are watching a film of a spoon bender in action. Once bent, the spoon is placed on a table. One set of people are then told that the spoon keeps on bending whilst others just watch the spoon without any additional suggestions. The film finishes and participants are asked ‘did the spoon keep on bending?’: 60% of those with the additional suggestion said ‘yes’ compared to only 40% without any additional input.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Anomalistic psychology is a branch of psychology which in layman’s terms could be classed as the psychology of paranormal belief. It is the use of science to test whether paranormal forces exist. In experiments you work on the hypothesis that <em>nothing</em> exists and try to challenge it by producing evidence to support the <em>event</em>. Alien abduction is an interesting area as it looks at the psychology of false memories (like the suggestive spoon bending!).","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"When the podcast finished the audience was asked to pose questions. Professor French was asked about his view of the role of forensic psychics in the USA and who he would class as the ancestors of parapsychology.
