Through <i>Fossil Necklace </i>we encounter five mass extinction events.

The most recent mass extinction was the most famous, the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/extinction_events/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Tertiary_extinction_event\">K/T extinction</a>, which resulted in the death of the dinosaurs and a subsequent abundance of competing “whodunnit?” theories. 65 million years later and in an age of uncontested human dominance, a number of scientists are speculating a future – or, more accurately, an already underway – sixth&nbsp;extinction event: the <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Holocene_extinction_event.html\">Holocene extinction</a>.
