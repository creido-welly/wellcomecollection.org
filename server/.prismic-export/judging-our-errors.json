We met him at Family Radio, a religious broadcaster in nearby Oakland. Family Radio is at the centre of a campaign to warn the world that 21 May 2011 will be Judgement Day. Like many of the people we met over the past weeks, Simon has wound down his business activities. Why amass more worldly goods if there is no tomorrow? Instead, he focuses on studying the prophecy and getting the word out. Belief in the Judgement Day prophecy comes at an emotional cost: friends and family regard him as crazy for his conviction.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"embeddedImage","value":{"non-repeat":{"caption":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Judgment Day Billboard.

In 1954, social psychologist Leon Festinger and his colleagues joined an end-time prophecy group to observe how people react when they discover their beliefs are wrong. He was driven by his emerging theory of cognitive dissonance. In the following years, dissonance theory was tested and refined in everyday settings. Researchers found that it is especially when our self-image as good, kind, smart and competent people is under threat that dealing with the idea of being wrong becomes so difficult.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Lunch is finished and we get ready to leave.
