We think it’s important to understand what people do on our websites, what they wish they could do, what they’d like to see more (and less) of and how they behave online generally.

It could be anything, from looking at how articles are presented on a web page to a short questionnaire about how you like to use your mobile phone. The feedback will then go straight back to the team and help them decide how best to make things happen.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"If you’re interested in <strong>joining the user panel</strong>, please <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/WWS6JLD\"><strong>tell us about yourself and sign up here</strong></a>.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"The other exciting project is for a piece of work on <strong>personas</strong>.
