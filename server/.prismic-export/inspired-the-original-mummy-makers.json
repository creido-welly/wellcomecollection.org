Preparation began by beheading and dismembering the body, before de-fleshing. Now the organs and bones could be removed and artificially heated to dry everything out. The bodies were reassembled with reinforcing sticks and sometimes grass stuffing. Everything was covered in a paste made from ash; a kind of ‘new’ skin. Once dried, they were painted either red or black and a stylised face was added. Preparing the dead was an elaborate process.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"The striking difference between these mummies and those from Egypt is who was mummified: the Chinchorro did not just preserve elite members of society. They buried their dead in communal cemeteries and included just about everyone – men, women, old, young and even the unborn. This custom is absent from the archaeological record from about 1500BCE. Why these people mummified their dead and why they stopped, we may never know. One thing is certain though, the practice seems to have spread across the continent. We encounter it, in varying forms, time and again and in multiple cultures.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Interestingly, when the world’s attention was on Egypt in the 1920s and ’30s, Henry Wellcome chose to collect mummies from South America.
