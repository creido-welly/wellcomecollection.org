Further, that original human voice, or song, has its origins in the need for humans to socially attach as changes took place within human evolution. Hominins essentially developed a new method of bonding to replace the increasingly inefficient and time-consuming physical grooming; vocal grooming if you like. Speech as we know it is exclusively human. It is behaviourally advanced and unprecedented, involving extraordinary use of our lips, tongue, larynx and as well as&nbsp;our brain.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"It was long believed that speech only evolved in the last 100,000 years, quite suddenly and was unique to modern humans. Early research suggested that only <em>Homo sapiens</em> had the ability to speak, largely because of the alignment of the hyoid bone in the neck. However, fossilised remains have since challenged this statement. Certainly, Neanderthals were not anatomically deficient and they were not so different from us after all. In addition, the importance of the hyoid may have been somewhat overstated. In fact, archaic hominins probably possessed the key physical make-up as far&nbsp;back as 500,000 years ago. Thus, it can be argued that speech acquisition was more transitional and rooted much deeper in antiquity.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"embeddedImage","value":{"non-repeat":{"caption":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"A Neanderthal skull next to a human skull.","spans":[]}}],"image":{"origin":{"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/129ed6cfd3b548a1675dedd3bd17.jpg","width":800,"height":557},"width":800,"height":557,"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/129ed6cfd3b548a1675dedd3bd17.jpg","edit":{"background":"transparent","zoom":1,"crop":{"x":0,"y":0}},"alt":"C0030549 Pre-historic Skulls","thumbnails":{}},"weight":"default"}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Of course, having the necessary vocal tools does not automatically mean that other species of hominins were utilising them as we have evolved to do.

Understanding the capabilities of extinct species of humans is fraught with difficulty especially as conclusions are merely interpretations of the evidence available.

Both the Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes have been sequenced, and DNA analysis is currently helping to confirm the relationship between modern and archaic humans.
