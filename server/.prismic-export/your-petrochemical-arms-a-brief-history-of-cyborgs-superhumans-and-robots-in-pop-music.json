They played with the relationship between humans and technology throughout their career, from the hench idealism of their cycling concept single <em>Tour De France</em>&nbsp;to their prophetic 1981 release <em>Computer World</em>.

The sampling of machinery and a stomping regularity to the music often causes them to be lumped in with the Industrial or Industrial Metal movements (which deserve a mention here as genres that have a large concern with the man-machine, often as metaphor), although their style is too restless to be truly genre-defined. Their music and lyrics often flirt with the idea of man’s relationship with technology, most candidly with their concept album <em>Jesus Christ Superstars</em>, which recasts Christ in the second coming as a Judge Dredd- or Robocop-type character.

With the single <em>Are Friends Electric?</em> the band scored a hit with an austere and melancholy tale of paranoid dystopia, a vein Numan explored in further detail later in his career (most notably with his song <em>Cars</em>, which espoused the protection and security of the machine).

With <em>O Superman</em> she&nbsp;got to number 2 in the UK charts&nbsp;with an eight-and-a-half-minute song that not only has no drums or real chorus but also has idiosyncratic, cryptic lyrics. The ‘Superman’ (übermensch again) in question seems to be the might of humanity, or the might of the West. Anderson alludes to several human enhancements such as telephones, answering machines and aeroplanes. The domestic aeroplane is compared to the American fighter jet, and although I think it may be reductive to call this purely an anti-war song, the sentiment seems to be a common thread in music which uses the man-machine as a metaphor. As we see in the video, robotic movements and electric lights in the mouth are used alongside the vocoder and electronic instruments to create a quietly futuristic atmosphere. But the real cyborgian moment comes in the closing lines: “So hold me, Mom, in your long arms. In your automatic arms. Your electronic arms. In your arms. Your petrochemical arms. Your military arms. In your electronic arms.”","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"youtubeVideo","value":{"non-repeat":{"embed":{"type":"video","embed_url":"https://youtube.com/watch?v=0hhm0NHhCBg"}}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daft_Punk\">Daft Punk</a> are probably the most commercial contemporary group to assume the guise of cyborgs.
