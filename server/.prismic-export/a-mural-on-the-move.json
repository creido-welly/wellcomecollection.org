During a jubilant dinner party held at the home of crystallographer Dr <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Desmond_Bernal\">John Desmond Bernal</a> in Torrington Square in 1950, Picasso stood up, with pencil and crayon in hand and drew a portrait of a man and woman with wings on the wall of the Professor’s sitting room. Years later when the house was assigned for demolition, the section of wall with Picasso’s drawing was removed for preservation. It is this original section of wall, complete with wooden lathes, horsehair and plaster that is the <em>Mural known as Bernal’s Picasso.</em>","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Murals are not common objects in this country so the rarity of the medium along with the legendary status of its creator makes this a particularly valuable artwork both in financial and historical terms. Measuring over 2.5 metres wide by 1.5 metres high and weighing nearly half a tonne, the mural is also a substantial object in physical terms. Over 60 years after its creation, I find myself confronted with the nerve-racking pleasure of overseeing the transportation and installation of this work into the Tate Liverpool gallery.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"It took a five and a half hour road trip in an air-ride vehicle, a crew of eight men and various pieces of lifting equipment to transport the mural from its home at Wellcome Collection, up the M1 to the surprisingly sunny city of Liverpool. Built as a shipping yard, the <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/historyhtml/bld_liverpool.htm\">Tate Liverpool building</a> and surrounding grounds are well suited to the arrival of large goods so the mural and I were soon whisked up to the 4th floor gallery via a vast industrial lift.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"During its lifetime, the mural has been in a series of changing climatic environments meaning that the layers of plaster and wood that make up the fabric of the wall have become separated over time, causing hairline cracks in the surface; an interior wall of a house is not built to be a museum piece after all. Due to this fragile condition of the artwork’s structure, once we delivered the mural into the gallery it was then left in its packaging to sit and acclimatise for several days, in order to prevent any further damage from sudden changes of temperature.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"I returned the following week to oversee the team of technicians unpack the piece. After the piece is unwrapped and before it is positioned on display, the artwork must be checked for signs of visible change that may have occurred during its recent journey. I carried out this ‘condition checking’ with a Tate conservator, using documentary photographs taken of the mural as a visual record. This means that the condition of the mural can be monitored throughout its display in Liverpool and a detailed comparison can be made when it eventually returns to Wellcome Collection in September.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"The head technician at Tate Liverpool had commissioned the construction of a bespoke display unit to accommodate the mural, and once this had been checked over, the mural was lifted into position by the team of eight art handlers.
