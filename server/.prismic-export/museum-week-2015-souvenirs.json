Marion explained that at the beginning, the shop stocked a lot of heavyweight academic textbooks, but it soon became clear that the visitors to Wellcome Collection, and its shop, tended to be the “curious public”.

However, she occasionally breaks those rules if she knows visitors will respond well. Interestingly, Marion tells me that when selecting a range of books for the shop, it’s as much about what you <em>don’t</em> stock; not diluting the offer, for example with more readily available or expected titles, lets more unusual, less ubiquitous books shine brighter. When exploring Wellcome Collection’s themes, it’s about offering what some people will hope to find, but also having the confidence to subvert expectations and think outside of the box.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"This sentiment is echoed by Lauren who tries to look beyond the obvious when selecting products and souvenirs to sell; she likes getting in things that are a little unexpected.

Both start many months in advance of a new exhibition, keeping their eyes open for anything that may fit a future theme and mentioning them to reps so that anything relevant being planned is brought to their attention.

Lauren speaks to the curators and finds out if they have any product ideas themselves, such as jewellery or ephemera relating to the subject. She can get a good sense of the tone from the curators this way. Marion points out that thinking creatively around the subject is important, while making sure not go down too obscure a route.

Marion said that both exhibitions really lend themselves to books and that there were a lot to choose from. The challenge was the tone: publishers pushed pornography and erotica for Sexology while a lot of the Forensics books were intense and rather graphic. Whereas the former were ill-suited to a show about the scientific study of sex, Marion was keen not to shy away from the intensity of the latter. The real challenge was making sure both large and popular exhibitions had enough space in the shop.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Lauren agreed, saying it can be hard to avoid tacky or indecent products when looking for merchandise related to Sexology.
