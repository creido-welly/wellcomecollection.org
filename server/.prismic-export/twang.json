The Wellcome Trust’s own Dan Glaser, an imaging neuroscientist by background, explored concepts of elasticity and plasticity in the brain. He described the way that researchers imaging the brain must “blow it up” when modelling it as if it were made of rubber, to smooth out the wrinkles and better interpret the images. He also described the elastic tension between our more primal selves and our modern sophistication, which can ping back at moments of stress to reveal our inner ape.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Jolyon Brewis, of <a title=\"Grimshaw-Architects\" href=\"http://www.grimshaw-architects.com\" target=\"_self\">Grimshaw-Architects</a>, discussed the idea of the Elastic City. He spoke about elasticity in building structures, demonstrating with some alarming computer models of movement in structures such as the Eden Project, which he worked on. More flexible than it looks, apparently. He then touched on buildings designed to change in form and purpose, and elasticity in planning.
