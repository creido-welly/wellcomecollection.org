The campaigns against tuberculosis and diphtheria were quite different in character, although both emphasized the importance of personal responsibility for one’s own and one’s children’s health and the right to universal entitlement to treatment and immunisation. Both were communicable diseases related to poverty and poor living conditions. The difference is that in 1937, when the film was made, diphtheria could be controlled by testing to see whether children could contract diphtheria (the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schick_test\">Schick test</a> – explained in a 1932 film now lost, <em>Bermondsey’s Germs</em>) and by inoculation against the diphtheria bacillus. Tuberculosis had then no such ‘cure’ and so nation-wide the public health authorities were all the more anxious to eradicate diphtheria.&nbsp; However, although the film does not directly address this issue, focusing instead on the hapless ‘Mrs. Smith’, parents were resistant to having their children inoculated with a toxoid and the number of films made by other public health authorities encouraging voluntary immunisation (Birmingham made <em>Diphtheria,</em><em>Prevention is better than Cure</em><em> (</em>1935) which shows babies being inoculated on an industrial scale) is a covert recognition of that resistance which also related to the &nbsp;issues of personal freedom and doubts about the necessity of vaccination.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"The film was made by two doctors: Dr. King Brown, former Medical officer of Health (MoH) for Bermondsey and with Dr. Salter, originator of the Department’s film project when in 1922 he produced <em>School in the Sun</em> for the Council.
