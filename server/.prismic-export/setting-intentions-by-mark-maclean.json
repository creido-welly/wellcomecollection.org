With an ever-growing evidence-base supporting its efficacy in the treatment of a wide range of mental and physical conditions, mindfulness has become a key feature of contemporary life. It is practised in schools, hospitals, corporate boardrooms and prisons, and delivered by psychologists, GPs and an array of smartphone apps.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"The ‘<a href=\"http://wellcomecollection.org/secrettemple\" target=\"_blank\">Tibet’s Secret Temple</a>‘ exhibition at Wellcome Collection offers rare insights into the radically different meanings that mindfulness carries in the world of Tibetan Buddhism. Entering the darkened chambers of the Lukhang temple, we encounter a sacred space where meditation is not a straightforward path to stress reduction, but a journey through unfathomable depths of ecstasy, vision and enlightenment.

The phenomenological experience of these changes has been painstakingly documented within Buddhist tradition for over two and a half millennia. In Tibetan Tantra, the path of meditative development is understood to be marked by a sequence of psychosomatic changes within the ‘subtle body’, inaccessible to ordinary perception. The Lukhang murals depict this process vividly. Adepts are shown with chakras glowing, energies coursing through an intricate network of channels and pathways throughout the body.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"As a teacher of mindfulness in clinical settings, I have found that a small but significant minority of Western mindfulness students report experiences that are uncannily similar to these descriptions of the ‘subtle body’ in Tibetan Tantra.

At the start of the body scan, participants set their intention to simply notice bare sensations as they arise: perhaps an itch, an ache, a gurgling stomach. They are discouraged from seeking to attain any ‘special states’ and are instructed to pay attention to ordinary embodied experiece with an attitude of curiosity and non-reactivity. With practice, the attention is honed to notice increasingly fine-grained details, such as the blood pulsing through capillaries near the surface of the skin, or the tickle of individual nostril hairs disturbed by the movement of the breath, and the complex interweaving of mood&nbsp;and bodily sensation.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"But as this process deepens, the familiar flesh and bone form can give way to an altogether stranger, shifting interior landscape.
