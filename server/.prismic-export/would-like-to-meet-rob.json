On top of the skull there are three holes, a result of trepanation procedure performed on a living patient to free him from a headache or perhaps a bad spirit living inside his head.

Every week we asked the visitors to the gallery and our twitter followers a question (for example “what is your favourite animal fact?”) and I would make a drawing on the gallery wall responding to their answers. The drawing in turn was left on the wall for a week and posted on social media. The project continued for around a year and a half and was probably among the most fulfilling and fun drawing I’ve ever done. A small thrill for me was to watch people laugh or walk away confused from the drawing as I patrolled the galleries as a VEA. It was interesting to me to see people’s true reactions to the drawings without them knowing that I was the artist.”</span>","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"embeddedImage","value":{"non-repeat":{"caption":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"One of Rob’s brilliant Curious Conversations drawings.","spans":[]}}],"image":{"origin":{"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/11434561793_597b5df141_k.jpg","width":1678,"height":1253},"width":1678,"height":1253,"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/11434561793_597b5df141_k.jpg","edit":{"background":"transparent","zoom":1,"crop":{"x":0,"y":0}},"alt":"","thumbnails":{}},"weight":"default"}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"We have quite a few works of art scattered around the Wellcome Collection and Rob knows more about our collection than anyone.
