We also find out why elasticity is not necessarily a good thing in a spider’s web (a hungry arachnid doesn’t want to see her fly bouncing off like a trampolinist), and why, at the quantum level, space and time themselves are elastic (likened by physicist John Wheeler to bath foam).","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"If you want to bone up beforehand, you can <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Findings-Elasticity-Pars-Foundation/dp/3037781483\">buy the book</a>; or simply broaden your horizons at the <a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/events/treats-on-elasticity.aspx\">event itself</a>.","spans":[]}}]}}}]}
