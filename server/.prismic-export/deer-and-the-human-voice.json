According to the source-filter theory of voice production, we generate our voice in two stages.

Men have lower pitched voices because they have much longer vocal folds that vibrate at a lower frequency.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Then, in the second stage, this source soundwave is filtered in the speaker’s vocal tract, whose resonance properties affect the timbre of the voice.
