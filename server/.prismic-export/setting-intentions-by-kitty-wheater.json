I enjoyed the idea of temple-building as an act of appeasement, responding to a metaphysical knock on the door by an unfortunate and disenfranchised <em>lu</em>. To me it resembled the processes of setting New Year intentions and resolutions that at this time of year fill both the newspapers and our reflective moments. These new, or renewed, intentions are often grounded in a sense of appeasement, or reconfiguration; something has been knocking on <em>our</em> metaphysical door. The new year has an impetus, a sense of ending and beginning that invites reassessment of where one is going, and an opportunity to redirect the course: to build a metaphorical temple that honours something we had forgotten, or that has been left behind.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"While we’re told to make our New Year resolutions specific, measurable and achievable for the best chance of success – “I will go to the gym three times a week for an hour” – an <em>intention</em> is somewhat different from a goal and deserves equal consideration at this time of year. Among the mindfulness practitioners with whom I practise, teach and conduct research, intention is a frequently-cited concept. It is bigger-picture in scope than a goal and doesn’t have a specific tick-box or end-point. It’s more of an orientation; a direction that, like all directions, is an emergent property both of where we are now and also of where we hope to go next. It doesn’t belong solely to the separate, better ‘us’ that we will be in six months’ time; it is forever formative, expressed through our sense of direction in the here and now. This is what gives an intention its sense of resonance and meaning.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"embeddedImage","value":{"non-repeat":{"caption":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Statue of the 5th Dalai Lama.

Mindfulness, taught in a variety of contexts from schools to hospitals, retrains the attention to pick up on a wider variety of experience: to include what is usually neglected or ignored – our own personal <em>lu</em>; to hold in wider perspective what we usually zoom into – that magnificent palace on whose building we’ve set our hearts. By allowing our experience to include both of these, we can reflect on whether the palace is the goal that we will pursue at any cost, or whether the arrival of the <em>lu</em> is a warning sign that we have actually strayed from our bigger-picture direction – whether that’s towards compassion, clarity, learning, creativity or health – that now requires some remedial action.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"The idea of setting our intention presupposes bravery, because it assumes that we as individuals have the capacity in some way to set our own course. It also requires the willingness to be creative when life throws a <em>lu</em> into the works. We grant the <em>lu</em> an audience because we trust that whatever it asks, we will have the capacity to respond in some way that honours our principles, even if we can’t call a halt to the construction of the Palace and even if we don’t have enough bricks specifically for a temple. In fact, because an intention is somewhat bigger-picture than a goal, it has a little more resilience and autonomy than a goal when we come up against conditions that limit our capacity to act. Our intention is not something that we will achieve or conquer, although we can delight in the accomplishment of a goal well-met. Instead, it is something to which we ‘stay true’ or ‘align’: it’s the direction we choose to take when events arise that are both expected and unexpected, congruent and incongruent.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"embeddedImage","value":{"non-repeat":{"caption":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Full model of the Lukhang Temple by Capital Models, 2015.
