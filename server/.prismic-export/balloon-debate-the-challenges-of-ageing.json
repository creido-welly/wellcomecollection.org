Though he found some fans in the audience, Mary Warnock, in her 80s herself, later said she wouldn’t actually be that pleased if someone came knocking on her door with baby in tow.&nbsp; Andrew was the first to go, so perhaps many in the audience agreed with Mary, though Andrew did attract some positive comments when he wrote up his “Tea for Three” idea for a <a title=\"Andrew Harrop in the Guardian\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/joepublic/2010/feb/18/old-people-loneliness-isolation-children\" target=\"_self\">Guardian blog</a>.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Hugh Perry was up next, proposing that his million be spent furthering the research done by his own team at Southampton on the <a title=\"Systemic infections and inflammation affect chronic neurodegeneration\" href=\"http://www.nature.com/nri/journal/v7/n2/full/nri2015.html\" target=\"_self\">links between infection and cognitive decline in dementia patients</a>. He described this as an issue which has been ‘hidden in plain view’ – known anecdotally to carers and medical practitioners, but never properly studied and understood. Perry’s research over a six month period showed that patients who had suffered inflammatory disease below the neck had a significantly greater rate of cognitive decline than those who hadn’t. He had already begun to work on understanding the mechanism behind this effect, but called for more money to progress this work into something clinically useful.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Finally, Mary Warnock took to the podium having decided to split her potential pot of money into two halves. The first, she said, should be used to tackle the inexperience of many hospital nursing staff in dealing with patients that may come into hospital for something like a fall, but also suffer from symptoms of dementia. It seems that these patients are more likely to stay ill and in hospital for longer than patients without dementia, which may be down to the way they are treated (a subject which Andrea Gillies has been moved to<a title=\"Andrea Gillies on dementia patients in hospital\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/nov/17/dementia-nhs-care-elderly-hospital\" target=\"_self\"> write about herself</a>).
