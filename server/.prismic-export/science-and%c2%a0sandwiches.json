It’s a more accessible and informal format than the standard lecture, more like a discussion you might hear on the radio. To that end, we decided to record each event and release it as a podcast, so that the events could reach a wider audience. We wanted to make it as informal as possible, so the events are drop-in, no booking required, and people are encouraged to bring their sandwiches to munch on as they listen.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"So, with the defining features of the series in place, I started approaching local institutions for suggestions of speakers (defined as ‘local’ by the highly scientific method of getting a map, drawing a circle of 1 mile radius around Wellcome Collection and seeing which institutions fell inside). I interview prospective guests over the phone, and then if I think their research fits with the ethos of the series, I invite them to come and speak. I look for subjects that are interesting, relevant to our audience’s lives, and possibly slightly quirky.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"A year on from the inaugural Packed Lunch event, the series is going strong, with standing room only at the last event (which featured UCL physicist <a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/events/packed-lunch-podcast/cern.aspx\">Jonathan Butterworth</a> talking about his other day job, at CERN).

People now come from much further afield than we initially expected them too (France, in one case! Although not specifically for our event, alas), but I think that we’ve succeeded with our original aim to showcase the great work being done right here in NW1.
