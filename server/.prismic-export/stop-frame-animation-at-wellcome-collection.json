This could be shortly after an operation or trip to the dentist involving anaesthetic, or when overtired, hungry or feverish. The participants looked like somnambulists themselves lying on the floor, their thoughts and memories being animated on and around them by their partners. This process stimulated active conversations between the groups about dreams and fears which led to the creation of some lovely short animated sequences.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"youtubeVideo","value":{"non-repeat":{"embed":{"type":"video","embed_url":"https://youtube.com/watch?v=OJWJE0x7T4Q"}}}},{"key":"heading","value":{"non-repeat":{"heading":"<strong>Technique 3: 3D objects</strong>"}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Wellcome Collection has a fantastic selection of weird and wonderful handling objects which we were able to animate and bring to life.

Luckily a lot of the young people stayed on for all three sessions, so I didn’t need to go over the introduction multiple times and when new people joined I asked the existing participants to share their knowledge with them.
