The first forms of life were prokaryotes – small, simple cells. Eukaryotes, larger cells with mitochondria and other organelles, came after prokaryotes on the evolutionary timeline. It is supposed that eukaryotes evolved from prokaryotes. How, and why? It is generally believed that at some point in history, a large prokaryotic cell, such as a phagocyte, engulfed an ancestral form of a mitochondrion that once existed as a free-living organism. There is much argument and acrimony over how, when and why this happened.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"After gaining a PhD in biochemistry, Nick spent ten years ruminating on these questions as a professional writer, during which time he “rove across the world – a wonderful freedom”. He has authored three books: ‘<a href=\"http://www.nick-lane.net/About%20Oxygen.htm\">Oxygen: The molecule that made the world</a>‘; ‘<a href=\"http://www.nick-lane.net/Power,%20Sex,%20Suicide.html\">Power, Sex, Suicide: Mitochondria and the meaning of life</a>‘; and ‘<a href=\"http://www.nick-lane.net/About%20Life%20Ascending.htm\">Life Ascending: The ten great inventions of evolution</a>‘ (which has just been awarded the Royal Society <a href=\"http://royalsociety.org/news/book-prize-winner-2010/\">Prize for Science Books&nbsp;2010</a>). But through his exploration of these topics, he found that “time and time” again his own understanding “fell flat on its face”. It was time to go back to the lab.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Nine months ago Nick started scribbling on the back of an envelope. He was sketching out an idea that related extra energy to extra genes. At the moment of endosymbiosis, when an ancestral mitochondrion partnered with a eukaryotic cell, the genes from the mitochondrion provided the large cell with the “raw material for evolution”. Nick now supposes that the extra energy provided by the mitochondrion enabled the cell to support these extra genes. Whereas prokaryotic cells do not have the energy to carry large amounts of DNA, eukaryotic cells, with their mitochondrial powerhouses, can. This theory will be published in ‘Nature’ after five months of review. Nick says “some people will hate this paper”. Argument and acrimony.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Nick is also interested in the role mitochondria play in disease, and particular disorders related to ageing. Free radicals are an essential byproduct of the respiration process that happens in mitochondria. They ‘leak’ from mitochondria, which can cause damage in the body. Other scientists are researching free radicals as the causes of cancer, Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s. Nick is looking into how antioxidants and calorie restriction diets might be able to ‘mop-up’ free radicals and reduce the number that leak from mitochondria, thus reducing the damage they do. This work is ongoing. For the moment, it seems that mitochondria hold some of the secrets of both life and death.","spans":[]}}]}}}]}
