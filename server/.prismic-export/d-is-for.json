However, to entirely supplement our diet in this way we’d need to eat fish three or four times a day, which is simply not possible. This means that most of us during the colder months have sub-optimal levels.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"The childhood disease rickets is caused by severe vitamin D deficiency, and the role the vitamin plays in the absorption of calcium and hardening of bone is well understood. Less well understood is why else it may be important. Over the past 20 years it has been discovered that a wide variety of cells, not just those in the skin, can make vitamin D – with an equally diverse number of cells having chemical receptors to accept the molecule. This is an indicator that the vitamin is important and affects many parts of the body.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Population studies have shown that those with lower vitamin D levels tend to have higher incidences of a number of diseases, including diabetes and cancer.

Will raising the overall levels of the vitamin improve the nation’s health? Some foods, like breakfast cereals, are already fortified, and studies in other countries have shown that it is a safe practice. Thankfully it’s very difficult to take an overdose by mistake, with the body able to break down any excess when present.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"The speaker himself explained that he takes vitamin D pills to supplement his diet.
