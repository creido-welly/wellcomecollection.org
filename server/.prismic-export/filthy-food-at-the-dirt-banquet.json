He explained that Crossness was built after the Great Stink of 1858, when London’s River Thames was heavily contaminated with human waste and the smell of sewage was unbearable. 20,000 people died each year from cholera. Bazalgette built a sewer system that intercepted waste water and channeled it further east, down the river towards the sea. This required several pumping stations, and Crossness was built as one of them. The entire project was a feat of extraordinary engineering. In 1987, the Crossness Engines Trust was set up to renovate the pumping station, and so far the engine named “Prince Consort” has been restored to his former working glory.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"embeddedImage","value":{"non-repeat":{"caption":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Prince Consort pumping engine at London Crossness, by Thom May, on Flickr","spans":[]}}],"image":{"origin":{"url":"https://i0.wp.com/farm6.static.flickr.com/5305/5586517694_78c729878d.jpg","width":450,"height":300},"width":450,"height":300,"url":"https://i0.wp.com/farm6.static.flickr.com/5305/5586517694_78c729878d.jpg","edit":{"background":"transparent","zoom":1,"crop":{"x":0,"y":0}},"alt":"","thumbnails":{}},"weight":"default"}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"After the punch, my taste buds were tingling for some food.

Most of us are naturally revolted by faeces, vomit and rotting foods. We know now that these substances are potential sources of disease, but the disgust comes from something more deep-rooted.
