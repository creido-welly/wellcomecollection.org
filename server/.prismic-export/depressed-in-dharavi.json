The cost of medicines in India can be prohibitively expensive for the country's poor but can also place an immense strain on the middle-classes. Eighty per cent of people pay out of their own pockets for medical care – around seventy percent of which is spent on just buying necessary medications. It is also estimated that annually around forty million people are forced into poverty solely because of the quest to find funds for their health. In answer to providing affordable health care, India is the home of a substantial generic-drugs industry, which also then supplies low-cost medicines to other countries, including many in sub-Saharan Africa. But producing low-cost drugs is not as easy a solution as it seems. A 2015 FT report described how 'Western drug-makers have accused India of abusing their intellectual property to benefit local generic manufacturers, while Indian authorities and activists have accused foreign companies of defending spurious patents to keep drugs out of reach of the poor.' But solutions are always being sought.
