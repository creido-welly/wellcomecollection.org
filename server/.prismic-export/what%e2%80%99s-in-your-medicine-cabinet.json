We were intrigued and amazed by the amount of medicine an average UK citizen will take in a lifetime (approximately 14,000 pills). We began researching the theme in terms of the theatrical and choreographic possibilities using performers’ medical diaries. Betsy Field, a dancer in her 70s who used to be a pharmacist, joined us as a performer along with researchers from The School of Pharmacy interested in looking at issues facing social pharmacy being explored through dance. Dr Ian Banks and Professor Laura Obiols have been working with the company over the past year fuelling us with knowledge in exploratory meetings, and being hands on in rehearsals to help shape the content of the performances.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Using elements including Betsy’s childhood memory of being put to sleep with chloroform and dreaming of soldiers chasing her, and embarrassing medicine such as cream for pubic lice we created a twenty-minute performance entitled Initial Side Effects.

Scenes are inspired by the continued use of ‘The Pill’, treatment for the menopause, and insomnia. It is integral to the work of dANTE OR dIE to find the emotional response of people within the work we create. This has informed the choice of our title for the piece –the psychological and emotive side effects of taking medicine are put centre-stage for the performance, which promises to send you home to have a look in your own medicine cabinet, and consider how you have been affected by pills.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"You can see Side Effects in London at <a href=\"http://www.richmix.org.uk/\"><strong>Rich Mix</strong></a> from 10-13 February and at the <a href=\"http://www.trinitylaban.ac.uk/\"><strong>Laban Theatre</strong></a> on 1 March.
