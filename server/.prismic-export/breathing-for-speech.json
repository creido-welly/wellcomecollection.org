What can be somewhat less obvious is that for humans, breathing is also central to speech, and the way that we breathe when we speak is very different to the way that we breathe to stay alive (called metabolic breathing). If you use a breath belt to look at the movements of the rib cage during metabolic breathing, you see a very regular, almost sinusoidal profile of expansion as air is drawn in, followed by an elastic contraction that forces air out:","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"embeddedImage","value":{"non-repeat":{"caption":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"","spans":[]}}],"image":{"origin":{"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/slide1.jpg","width":720,"height":540},"width":720,"height":540,"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/slide1.jpg","edit":{"background":"transparent","zoom":1,"crop":{"x":0,"y":0}},"alt":"Slide1","thumbnails":{}},"weight":"default"}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"When we breathe to speak, we breathe very differently, taking in a breath and then using our intercostal muscles and diaphragm to control a fine flow of air through our larynx.
