One of the best ways of preventing transmission of these diseases is to stop people being bitten. There are lots of possible ways to do this, including controlling the population with insecticides or preventing biting at night by using a bednet, but I look at manipulating mosquito behaviour. How? I look at what makes the mosquito respond in a certain way and see if I can use that against it.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"I’m particularly interested in mosquitoes’ sense of smell.
