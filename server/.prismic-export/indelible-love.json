Did it hurt? Well, about as much as getting tight French plaits woven into my hair for a ballet exam. But not as much as dancing en pointe for it. The nearer the needle got to my spine, the more the vibrations caused an uncomfortable sensation of drilling. It took a lot less time than I thought and, once the tattoo had been finished, I was on a high. The gnawing pain was forgotten as endorphins rushed around my body.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"My tattoo is of a stylized swan, my favourite animal. ‘Swanny Wonny’ was an early Christmas present from my aunt – something about her cuddly yet graceful form captured me, and from then on I was swan mad. I collected ornaments, visited the swans at the local park and all my school art and woodwork creations represented the graceful bird. You could call it an obsession.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Two months before getting my tattoo, I had started working at Wellcome Images, so I offered my newly-inked back as a subject for photography.

My tattoo means more to me than what the pattern of ink markings show, it’s the reminder of someone I’ll never forget, my loves and my losses.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<em>Louise Crane is a Picture Researcher at the Wellcome Trust.</em>","spans":[]}}]}}}]}
