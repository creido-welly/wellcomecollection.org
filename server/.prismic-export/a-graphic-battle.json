But, as William Schupbach reminds us in his <a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/explore/sickness--health/topics/aids-posters/aids-posters.aspx\">introduction to the selection</a>, “paper posters continued because of their greater presence, durability and immediacy in the real world of the street, the nightclub and the support group”.
