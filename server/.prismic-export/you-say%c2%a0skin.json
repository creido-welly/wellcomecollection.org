The correspondent for <a href=\"http://heliconbristol.blogspot.com/2010/08/see-skin-exhibition-at-wellcome.html\">Bristol’s ‘Helicon’ arts blog</a> likened the experience to “recoiling from some gloriously riddled glittering treasure-box that you’re partly afraid to take from”. A strong stomach was also required, according to some: “apart from feeling like I wanted to vomit at the skin diseases on display,” wrote <a href=\"http://somebodycalledkerry.blogspot.com/2010/08/wellcome-collection-skin-exhibition.html\">Kerry Squires</a>, “many of the pieces were incredibly beautiful”. One of our favourite bloggers, <a href=\"http://annasayburn.wordpress.com/2010/09/03/goosebumps-from-skin-at-wellcome/\">Anna Sayburn</a>, noted that “there is something about skin – especially detached from its living, breathing embodiment – that prompts discomfort, unease, even disgust”.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://morbidfrog.livejournal.com/883792.html\">Morbid Frog</a> summed it up simply as “lots of whoaa and lots of beurk”.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<a href=\"http://www.artslant.com/lon/articles/show/18395\">Alex Field</a>, like many others was pleased to find many contemporary artists in the exhibition, “all of whom have created innovative works on the theme”. ‘Skin’ provided not only evidence of long-lasting inspiration for artists, but also immediate fascination for artists visiting the gallery. <a href=\"http://keepyourlamp.blogspot.com/2010/08/credit-wellcome-library-london-ecorche.html\">Eleanor Crook</a> (a sculptor and wax model artist who you might recall from this <a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/explore/science--art/video.aspx\">Exquisite Bodies video</a>) relished the chance to see a long-admired ecorché drawing by Charles Landseer in the flesh. <a href=\"http://wendyhelpsmadesignermaker.blogspot.com/2010/09/skin-wellcome-collection.html\">Wendy Helps</a> found the contemporary art on display particularly interesting for her research into touch.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<a href=\"http://sarahhousley.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/skin-at-the-wellcome-trust/\">Sarah Housley</a> wasn’t alone in seeing an element of cruelty in the exhibition: “Lots of drawings of vaginas and male hands rummaging around, and lots of reminders of how hideous men were to women”. Many writers also noted the sinister implications of an early 20th-century photograph displaying <a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/exhibitions/skin/image-galleries/marks.aspx?view=dermographisme\">writing on the back of a female patient</a>, apparently carving a psychiatric diagnosis into the patient’s flesh (the truth is more complex: see this blog post on the skin condition known as <a href=\"../../../../../2010/07/27/written-on-thebody/\">dermatographic urticaria</a>).","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"‘Skin’ also prompted very personal reflections. <a href=\"http://karenrumsey-home.blogspot.com/2010/08/skin-suture-and-sex-at-wellcome.html\">Karen Rumsey</a> picked up a common thread of feeling, responding to images of aged, stitched and scarred skin: “suturing, disease and ageing are less imperfections in the skin and more a part of the tale telling of our lives on our own surfaces”. <a href=\"http://philipcarrgomm.wordpress.com/2010/07/18/nhs-should-consider-nude-therapy-to-replace-sedatives/\">Philip Carr-Gomm</a> also reflected on his own experience and feelings about nakedness after delivering a talk as part of our ‘Skin: EXPOSED’ symposium.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<em>We want to keep track of what bloggers are saying about Wellcome Collection.
