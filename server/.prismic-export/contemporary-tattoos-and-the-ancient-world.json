Undoubtedly the advancement of equipment played a vital role – thanks to the first patented electric tattoo machine (developed by Samuel O’Reilly in 1891 as a modified version of Edison’s electrically powered ‘stencil pen’), tattooing became much faster, safer and less painful. But it wasn’t until the 1960s with flower power, rock and roll and the prospering of the West that the climate seemed right for forms of body decoration to flourish.

These types of imagery are particularly popular with the modern tattoo crowd, with the style known as modern-day ‘tribal’ being one of the most common.
