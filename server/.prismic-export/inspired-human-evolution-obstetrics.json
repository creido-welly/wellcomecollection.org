Evidence for this can be seen in&nbsp;the frequency and nature in which we encounter obstetric problems. Neonatal and maternity mortality rates are high. Modern day births are highly controlled, highly medicalised and highly reliant on technological intervention. Startlingly, one in three babies in the USA are born via caesarean. Australian midwives find it near impossible to get insurance cover for home births. The chief cause seems to be a problematic birth canal; we have to search our deep ancestral past to find out why.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"The discovery in 1974 of ‘Lucy’, a 3.2 million year old hominid <em>Australopithicus afarensis</em>, provided us with a critical point of reference in our understanding of human evolution.

The permanent adaptation to upright walking has necessitated a pelvic arrangement with a characteristically narrow birth canal. Babies have to be expelled at a time when they can fit through and, thus, are actually born ‘too early’ at nine months. This would explain the excessive degree to which newborn babies are vulnerable. They are unable to gain nutrition, warmth and protection without the intervention of another human, i.e an innate inability to self-care; an extended childhood.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Giving birth is also a vulnerable time for the mother and, again, the intervention of others is required.
