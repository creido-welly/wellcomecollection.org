And so, each night, dinner would be brought to my room by Frank, a warm, friendly member of staff, who would carefully lay the table, place the array of food he had made on the table and leave. The one time the hotel did indulge in communal dining was breakfast, an experience shared not just by the diners but by the hotel’s pet deer.

As we wandered around the hospital grounds, the area was dotted with nurses having their lunch on the grass.

Again, it was important to film with sensitivity; to capture these images without crossing the line into voyeurism.

Before interviewing him, I watched he and his assistant in action, speaking with visitors from the local town, collecting data about tuberculosis; trying to piece together human movement with disease. It also becomes very apparent how critical personality is. People like Frank need to gain the trust of the locals quickly, often via meeting and working with the town’s leader. After just a few seconds with Frank, it’s obvious why he’s so well matched to the task: a large, open smile and a firm handshake quickly followed up by a shoulder barge.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Then it was Elson’s turn to be interviewed. A canny man, he took me back to his scenic cottage, in a very nice part of town it turned out – but, as with many places here, the relatively rich rub uncomfortable shoulders with the relatively poor. Elson had also brought a couple of friends along, one, it turned out, a singer of local repute – Agoroso.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"After clearing the set of people, we did our interview, much to the delight of the chickens on the grounds who seemed to cluck furiously every time Elson said something profound. As always, the challenge in such a situation (one of ignorance with no possibility of doing a recce), is to do the very best you can with what you have. In this case, I positioned Elson so that he had natural light on his eyes and placed a large piece of his own art behind him as a backdrop.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"To compensate for the chickens’ enthusiasm, Agorosso decided to put on a spontaneous performance in Elson’s garden. There followed three, lovely acoustic tracks as we watched and listened, entranced. So entranced that I didn’t notice the tripod get knocked and the camera fall to the ground, smashing its eyepiece off. Trying to regain calm, with two more days of filming to go, I grabbed the camera and quickly noticed it couldn’t focus. My heart started a downward trajectory. Fortunately, common sense kicked in and I adopted what should always be the first course of action with any technical piece of kit: turn it off and on again. To my joy, the camera found focus – we all cheered!","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"On the way back to the centre, Bertha, my largely silent yet efficient companion, commented on my apparently remarkable ability to remember faces and names. This, it seems, is not a common ability or trait she has witnessed in Blantyre. The other trait she told me I exhibited was a close adherence to “English Time”, a term used to describe punctuality. This will not be a surprise to my colleagues. However, it seemed my use of time as an actual reference point to be adhered to was a largely alien notion.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<b>Barriers</b>","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F80069684\"></iframe>","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"The next day, after having breakfast with the wide-eyed deer, I went with Anja, a clinician working at the Programme, and Bertha to Chikwawa.

For example, there is no word in the local language to describe a small tube. This means that when people are being asked for blood samples, they can think they’re being asked to fill up a bottle the size of a soft drink receptacle. Add to this the suspicion that one’s blood may not be used for scientific purposes but to drink and the cultural waters become rather muddy.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Superstition is rife in Malawi. Christianity may have a strong foothold but local healers and witch doctors are commonplace and hold powerful sway over people. This becomes a medical issue when faced with a choice of seeing the local healer, who lives in the village or getting up around 4am in the morning and walking up to 20km to the hospital. People die because sometimes they have no medical options and it’s thanks to people like Anja that the mystery surrounding medical practice is shrinking and the likelihood of medical intervention is becoming a tangible alternative.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"The conditions the scientists work in here are rudimentary, cramped and very hot. A single refrigerated room exists to maintain the medicine. Everyone else just gets used to the incredible humidity.

The juxtaposition of suffering and sickness alongside selfless people doing their level best to help others survive I found profound.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Then, in a triumph of Malawian over English Time, we were informed that a group of schoolchildren had been waiting for us to show up for around two hours at their local school. We departed quickly, Elson elaborating on why the level of education in Blantyre was relatively poor – a child must be old enough to walk to and from school. So while, in the UK, a child enters school before five years old, here, they can’t learn until they can cover large distances on foot.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Despite the wait, the children, adorned in their best blue and red uniforms, seemed in good nature. No doubt because Elson, ever the marketeer, had told them I had come over from the UK specifically to film them. Observing both Elson and the children working was fantastic. His enthusiasm fed theirs as they drew their own health-inspired art on large, bespoke canvases. Elson’s plan was to collect their art and display it in a gallery.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"And then, just as my second camera battery was almost out, something magical happened. Without any warning, the children assembled into a group, and sang. Feet stamped a rhythm and voices joined in harmonic unison to create some of the best music I had ever heard. It was moving. They belted out three songs in all, Elson and Bertha joining in on the last one, singing, dancing, joyous.
