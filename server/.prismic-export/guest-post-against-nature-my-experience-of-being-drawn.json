My love for his description of hothouse flowers – which, even with their wounded, scarred appearance, retain a sense of exotic beauty and wonder – fitted with Gemma’s interests and artworks perfectly.

Even the audio interview was different and new; I didn’t have a camera in my face or a stern journalist asking the same old questions before putting words in my mouth.

I’ve also had comments throughout my life that imply that I, and my skin, aren’t natural, that genetic defects are ‘against nature’. But it is also perfect because this treatment, and any other medical intervention, is ‘against nature’.
