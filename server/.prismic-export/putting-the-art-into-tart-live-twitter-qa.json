In 1991, the Wellcome Library (on the Euston Road) was in the middle of London’s sex trade (King’s Cross, Baker Street, Mayfair) and local telephone boxes housed an ever-changing selection of photocopied, coloured cards advertising prostitutes’ services. It made sense that we preserve some of these for posterity, building up a chronological document telling the story of what was being offered and who was offering it, as well as the evolving design and reproduction of the cards themselves. The ephemera collection now houses about 4,500 cards (from 1991 to the present day) in 20 box files.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"embeddedImage","value":{"non-repeat":{"caption":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"A selection of the cards from the collection.","spans":[]}}],"image":{"origin":{"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/dsc_0244_0244.jpg","width":1000,"height":673},"width":1000,"height":673,"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/dsc_0244_0244.jpg","edit":{"background":"transparent","zoom":1,"crop":{"x":0,"y":0}},"alt":"A selection of the cards from the collection.","thumbnails":{}},"weight":"default"}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Design changed from borrowed, photocopied and hand-drawn images with dry transfer Letraset type through to the full colour, digitally produced cards that appear today.

Desktop publishing arrived in the 1990s and photocopying moved to print in about 1994. Nipples in photographs were blocked out by coloured stars (so as not to offend public decency, one assumes) until 2012, when the first nipples began to appear.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Trends are quite apparent. For instance: transsexual prostitutes appear from about 1999; and ethnic-minority prostitution increases (possibly reflecting trafficking of young women, which became much more common after about 1999, although Asian and black women were apparent from the start of our collection). There are students (paying their way through college?), and teams of two or three young women advertising “lesbian” sex (2007). Interestingly only four men feature in the collection (West End Luke, Naughty Jason, Man-to-Man Dave and Man-to-Man Grant), around 1994, the men preferring to advertise in the back of the weekly gay free press at the time.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"embeddedImage","value":{"non-repeat":{"caption":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"A selection of the cards from the collection.","spans":[]}}],"image":{"origin":{"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/dsc_0242_0242.jpg","width":1000,"height":855},"width":1000,"height":855,"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/dsc_0242_0242.jpg","edit":{"background":"transparent","zoom":1,"crop":{"x":0,"y":0}},"alt":"A selection of the cards from the collection.","thumbnails":{}},"weight":"default"}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Staple services included ordinary sex (“Roses are red, violets are blue, St. Valentine’s coming and so may you” – February 1992), oral sex (Miss Deep Throat), electrocution (“Get a BUZZ at Madame Electrique’s”), ‘schoolgirls’ (“Naughty schoolgirls want some fun, dress me up and spank my bum”), spanking, whipping (“No school dinners here, only lashings of discipline CORRECTLY GIVEN”), domination (“human doormat required” and the Venus Man Trap), bondage, cross-dressing (“Femininity found”), “rubber rumpus with Madame Sin” and Naughty Sammy Nipples.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"The landline numbers advertised were cut off and replaced with others (and others…), but the mobile phone crept in and is now standard on all cards.
