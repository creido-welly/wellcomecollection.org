But it isn’t as unreactive as it seems. One of the experiments that Andrea demonstrates in the film above is what happens when you drop mercury onto gold leaf. The gold dissolves into the mercury, leaving an amalgam. This process has been used to separate out gold in the mining process, after which the mercury and gold amalgam is heated and the mercury evaporates away again. However, mercury is toxic, and Andrea pointed out that in some places careless use of this process allows mercury to <a title=\"The Ecologist on mercury poisoning as a result of gold mining\" href=\"http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/1122019/the_hidden_costs_of_gold_mercury_poisoning_blights_mining_communities.html\">escape into the environment and into water systems</a>.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Another way of dissolving gold is to use ‘aqua regia’, which is also demonstrated in the film.
