The more a person was predisposed towards, say, benevolence, the greater brain mass they would have in that specific area and the skull would, in turn, possess a larger bump to reflect this. Today, this form of neurological interpretation, or Phrenology, is considered a pseudoscience. And rightly so, as it turns out there wasn’t a shred of biological evidence to support this immensely popular theory of the time.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"But it would be unfair to dismiss Gall and his thinking out of hand. Prior to Gall’s ideas during the late 18th Century, the brain was still widely perceived as a rather mysterious, grey mass. It had garnered a reputation of scientific import, largely thanks to the English physician, Thomas Willis (1621-1675) and his groundbreaking anatomical work, Cerebri Anatome (1664), but was still a largely unknown quantity with respect to precisely which bits do what. Gall had missed the mark by trying to assign specious functions to the shape of the exterior skull but he was absolutely bang on with respect to functional localization of the brain and its rippled cortex.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Following on from these ideas, other scientists were able to start biologically and functionally dissecting the brain, assigning not instincts and behaviours to specific anatomical regions but higher thought, movement, vision, hearing… The questions now surrounding the brain are less about which parts of this remarkable organ do what and more about how they achieve what they do in such a seamless, integrated manner.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<em>Barry Gibb is a Multimedia Editor at the Wellcome Trust</em>","spans":[]}}]}}}]}
