The <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/langerlab/\">Langer Lab</a> is the biggest biochemical lab in the world and contains over 100 researchers from a wide variety of different fields. It is also said to be MIT’s biggest money maker, as many of Dr Langer’s discoveries have high value applications in the pharmaceutical industry. While monetary reward is a good thing for the continued funding of research, it’s not Robert Langer’s primary focus. “Some people are driven to science by enormous curiosity and the pure beauty of it. That’s not me. I think science is an incredibly powerful tool to change the world. That’s what I wanted to do,” he said in his Joseph Priestly Award speech earlier this year. “I had this dream of using my background in chemistry and chemical engineering to improve people’s lives.”","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"At the event itself, held in the auditorium of the Koch Institute just a few floors away from his vast lab, an audience peppered with fellow researchers and MIT alumni questioned Langer on his thoughts about the relationship between research and industry, the thrill of making new discoveries, and the future of bioengineering. There was a buzz to being there on his own territory, in the very building where his most exciting discoveries have been made.
