From the beginnings in New York to modern voguing and performance categories,&nbsp;</em>Duane Nasis&nbsp;<em>explores this dance culture.</em>By the 80s, aside from evolving to become a mecca for gay and trans People Of Colour, the ballroom scene in Harlem had developed it’s own unique set of performance conventions.Participants would ‘walk’ in ‘categories’ along a makeshift runway and be scored out of ten by a panel of judges before competing simultaneously against each other in battles. To this day this pre-selection process is referred to in ballroom as ‘getting your tens’.Within the balls, however, a new category began to emerge with a distinctly New York flavour. This category was initially referred to as ‘Performance’ or ‘Posing’ before adopting the catch all moniker by which it is known today: Voguing.Developed by trans women within ballroom as a way to exaggerate their couture, it involved executing a lyrical series of fashion poses to express both their feminine identity and desire for opulence. This concept proved extremely popular amongst the politically &amp; economically disenfranchised Black &amp; Latino gay community, for whom the extravagance of prime-time television and fashion advertising seemed an unattainable dream.<strong></strong><strong>Members of the London Ballroom Scene&nbsp;and friends will be performing at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wellcomecollection.org/bodylanguage\">Friday Late Spectacular: Body Language</a>&nbsp;on Friday 4 November.</strong><em><a href=\"http://www.duanenasis.co.uk/\">Duane Nasis</a>&nbsp;is an</em>&nbsp;O<em>ld Way Voguer and Art Director, who creates and develops concepts for various moving image projects from stop-motion animation and commercials to music videos.&nbsp;</em><em>Featured Image: Tina Montana at the Avis Pendavis Ball, 1990.
