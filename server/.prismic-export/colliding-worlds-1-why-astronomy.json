I came rather gradually to astronomy. When I was at school I specialised in science more because I was bad at languages than for any other reason. I turned out to be good at mathematics, so it seemed natural to study that subject at university. But I quickly realised I was not cut out to be a mathematician and prefered a more ‘synoptic’ subject where I could apply my mathematical skills to some complex phenomena. I thought of being an economist but for various reasons I ended up doing astrophysics. This was in the 1960s — a specially good time for a beginner, because the subject was opening up with the first discovery of black holes, the first evidence of big bang, etc.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<strong>Hans Ulrich Obrist</strong>","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"You were a pioneer of actually proposing these very big black holes as sort of power quasars. I was speaking to Gerhard Richter the other day, and he said his was all student work but then at a certain moment he had this revelation of the first kind of blurred photographic painting and that marked the number one in his catalogue raisonné. Now, a scientist doesn’t have that much of a catalogue raisonné as an artist – obviously there are the published papers and there are the books – but where would your catalogue raisonné start? What was the first discovery or paper you wrote where you felt that it was your breakthrough, that you had found your language?","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<strong>Martin Rees</strong>","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Well, when new objects are discovered, normally they often display some mysterious aspects that pose a puzzle. When a subject is new, the experience of older people is at a heavy discount and young scientists can immediately make an impact.
