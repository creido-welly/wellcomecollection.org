If it was all down to the brooding melancholics, the lazy phlegmatics and the friendly and pleasure seeking sanguines, not much would happen. The choleric is the most active of the four temperaments: they are hot and dry, fiery, creatures. At their best they’re ambitious, brave and proud; more often they’re vindictive, deceitful and violent. And, without exception, irritable and bad tempered. The typical choleric is lean and quick with&nbsp;dry curly hair (often red). The hot-headed cholerics can never sit still or keep their mouths shut, unless it’s&nbsp;part of a clever scheme thought out beforehand of course.

A female&nbsp;melancholic was considered to be something much more natural, acceptable and attractive than a male melancholic. He would be considered a quite useless individual.

Ten deaths occur as a result of strong feelings and apparently everyone is at risk, both sexes and all age groups are represented. The three deaths that actually happen on stage in front of the eyes of the audience are caused by grief for the loss of a loved one, but too much of any emotion was seen as dangerous at a time when balance equalled health.
