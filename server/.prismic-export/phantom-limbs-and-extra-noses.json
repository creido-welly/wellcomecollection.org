Effects like this suggest that the signals the brain receives from nerves from all over the body continuously shape our mental picture of our body, what is commonly called the ‘body image’. Other illusions make people feel like their waist is wider or thinner than it really is, or even that their nose is getting longer like they were Pinocchio!","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Recent research has begun to quantify effects like this and to investigate the underlying processes in the brain.

You’ll be able to try out the ‘mirror box’ that allows amputees to ‘see’ their phantom limb, or to experience the feeling that your own face has become merged with somebody else’s. You can sense how a prosthetic hand really feels like part of your body, or even experience having two noses. We’ll explain how scientists are using these illusions to reveal how the mind represents the body, how different senses such as vision and touch become integrated, and how these processes are implemented in the brain.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"We hope to see you there.&nbsp; Don’t forget to bring your body!","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<em><em><a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/events/wrong.aspx\">Wrong!</a> is at Wellcome Collection on 5 July.</em> Matt Longo is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Psychological Sciences at Birkbeck.
