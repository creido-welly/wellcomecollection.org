One is that they provide an opportunity to observe how the target audience for something you helped create behave and what they say in the exhibition space.

They may, as curator Rowan Watson has written, be “paraded as marks of conspicuous consumption”, like the gold-embossed works of Shakespeare owned by Laurence, a character in Mike Leigh’s 1977 play <em>Abigail’s Party.</em> “Part of our heritage,” says Laurence, “course, it’s not something you can actually read.”","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Books may also play ceremonial roles (think of priests kissing missals or witnesses swearing on the Bible in court) or be used as measures of intellectual richness.
