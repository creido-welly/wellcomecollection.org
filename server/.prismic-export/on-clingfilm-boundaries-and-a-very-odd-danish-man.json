We potentially have access to the objects in the boxes, as the unusual use of clingfilm as a boundary between the audience the the object creates a vulnerable window. One poke and the window is broken. But what would that do? We could steal it, touch it, see it better. However, the creation of a collection and the environment of an exhibition tends to seal every objects in its rightful place with a solid layer of trust and respect, but this time with a tiny pinch of ‘what if?’.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Clingfilm also creates an interesting texture, transparent but slightly cloudy and creased at the same time.
