The Natsal survey generated vast swathes of stats, so we needed to select the right bits.

We looked for the most interesting data sets – the sort of stuff people would discuss with friends at the pub. These would pull users into the site and compel them to share with their friends. The data needed to be illuminating. It needed to show change over time or an anomaly that would shed some light on an interesting social and cultural issue. Finally, we needed to cover a broad range of issues across behaviours, attitudes, age groups, sexualities and genders. We had to balance being entertaining, whilst also being informative.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"With a data visualisation project, you need to start with the data.
