With alcohol gels and state-of-the-art hand dryers, washing your hands is no chore: it is often a novel experience. As we are increasingly made aware of the health risks associated with poor hand hygiene, this particular pattern of human behaviour is becoming ever more instinctive, a ritual embedded in the working life of many professions.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Images of menacing, troll-like germs dance about in TV advertisements for intensive high-powered cleaning products, as we are encouraged to leave no fingernail unturned.

Since the claims of Dr <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis\">Ignaz Semmelweis</a> and the discovery of micro-organisms, we have developed significant biomedical evidence that ‘clean hands are healing hands’; appropriate hand hygiene is now standard protocol for infection prevention and control in hospitals and one of the most effective ways of reducing cross-contamination.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Children, in particular, are a major target for ‘wash your hands’ promotions. Many parents carry antibacterial wipes with them wherever they go, conducting regular front-to-back hand checks. In schools, teachers instruct hand washing intervals throughout the school day. Some even time their pupil’s hand washing with a stopwatch, and in Jewish schools a special cup is provided for the pupils to perform their <a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Perform-Netilat-Yadayim\">Netilat Yadayim</a>,<em></em>a custom that involves pouring water over the hands three times.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Although some parents are faced with challenges in convincing their children that hand washing is a good idea, generally young people today are pretty well practiced in the procedure. To what extent do children understand why they wash their hands? Is their hand washing effective? Are we teaching them to be overly concerned with cleanliness, without first explaining the reasons why we wash our hands?","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Developing creative projects with patients at <a href=\"http://www.gosh.org/\">Great Ormond Street Hospital</a>, I became aware of a paradox between the instinctive need young children have to investigate their environment and the acute implications of spreading infections through this physical ‘hands on’ exploration.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Hands are seen as the primary organs for physically manipulating the environment. With the fingertips containing some of the densest areas of nerve endings on the body, our sense of touch is intimately associated with the hands. Young children’s hands appear delicate and unscathed by a world that will later shape and be shaped by them. Just beginning to feel and examine, they use their hands to reach out beyond themselves, to communicate and understand, quickly enticed by the pleasure of getting dirty.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Some patients I visited had been inpatients for some time, living in closely monitored conditions, many unable to move from their rooms. Infection prevention and control is crucial in this environment, with intricate filtration systems built into the architecture, releasing or securing harmful airborne pathogens.

The younger children thought about what we find underneath the skin on hands, why we have bones, nerves, etc and how we are able to pick things up, touch things and know what they feel like. When I asked Amy (age 4) what she thought her hands were made of and what was under the skin, she said “they are filled with soap”. Analease (age 5) said that without bones in our hands “we couldn’t drive a car or play with our friends”.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Some of the older children designed their own micro-organisms. <em>Tresmitis </em>was a type of bacteria that liked to live in hair and also wore a hat! Rachel (age 12) named her made-up-microbe <em>Antidisestablishliceterianism</em>! These young people learnt about microbiology and the types of organisms that exist without us necessarily being able to see them. They gained a more informed perspective of ‘germs’ and an understanding of the significance of micro-organisms to the environment by taking samples from themselves and the objects around them. They considered more philosophical questions about hand washing.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"When asked, “Do you think people have always washed their hands?” Garret (age 10) said “No, no, not for cave men… Because did you know that real men actually come from gorillas? … Gorillas and humans are the only animals that have opposable thumbs.” David (age 10) told me how he washed his hands with a washing cup. “It has two handles … we use the same one at school.” David went to a Jewish school and said, “we wash our hands before lunch,” and his mum added: “before eating bread”.
