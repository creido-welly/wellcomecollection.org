Yet, we also wondered how private these images really were. Perhaps they were circulated among a small group of people with similar interests or desires.

He might also have looked at the pictures and wondered whether the individual was expressing homosexual desires or a wish to be a woman. Discussing these questions in the exhibition, it became clear that it is impossible to offer definitive answers. After all, some visitors cautioned, the images might not have anything to do with the expression of innermost desires or a deep-rooted sense of self at all.

Looking at the three images side by side, we talked about how it is not primarily the physical body that determines how we see ourselves and how we are perceived by others.
