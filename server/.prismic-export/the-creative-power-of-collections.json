Here he spent time rummaging and pondering, combining and imagining different shapes. Moore handled these artefacts and cast plaster copies of some of them – which he might then add to and change – as a way of turning out forms he said he “could never have thought of the day before”.

However, it’s fair to say that I subscribe to the French art critic Felix Feneon’s view of curators as “catalysts”, or invisible agents that facilitate the combination of things to make something new, just as Henry Moore’s rummaging and moulding or Cornell’s organising and assembling did.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Catalysts, of course, only make an impact when they are in the presence of something else.

What’s more, Henry Wellcome might never have succeeded as a businessman (and therefore built his ultimately massive collection) if he hadn’t used early acquired objects to drive his company’s product and marketing design. For all these individuals, and for many others, the value of collections isn’t simply about facilitating curiosity, it’s also about developing creative processes and fuelling creative production.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<strong>Launch our digital story,</strong><strong><a href=\"http://digitalstories.wellcomecollection.org/pathways/2-the-collectors/\" target=\"_blank\">The Collectors</a>.</strong>","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<i>Anna is an award-winning researcher, writer and teacher.
