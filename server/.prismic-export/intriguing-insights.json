Obviously, an invitation to visit an academic library might be of limited appeal so we’ve tried instead to draw out some of the themes – both expected and unexpected – that run through our collections. You may not be interested in libraries per se, but you might well enjoy the chance to explore herbal medicine, history, art, travel, science, or quackery.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"As Library Outreach Officer and charged with managing this programme of show-and-tell sessions I felt I should lead by example.
