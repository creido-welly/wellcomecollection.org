The area is famous for being composed of many square gardens. In fact, Bloomsbury was the first site in London to be named “square”. It was first known as Southampton Square, laid in the 1660s by the 4th Earl of Southampton Thomas Wriothesley. His father was Henry Wriothesley, Shakespeare’s patron, and he was himself the father of Lady Rachel Russell – wife of William Russell, and still remembered today for her writing talents as well as her piety. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Russell family developed Bloomsbury into a fashionable residential area that attracted numerous artists and intellectuals, transforming the area into an ideal place for cultural innovations and the site of many ‘firsts’.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Among these, the most iconic example is probably the founding of the <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/the_museums_story/general_history.aspx\">British Museum</a> in 1753 as the first national public museum in the world. Since opening to the public in 1759, the museum has granted free admission to all ‘studious and curious persons’.

UCL was created to open up education in England for the first time to students of any race or religion. The philosopher <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham\">Jeremy Bentham</a> is traditionally considered as the founder of UCL – the display of his clothed skeleton in the college’s Cloisters can be misleading! In reality, Bentham played no active part in establishing the college, although his ideas and philosophy did inspire its foundation. He also helped to fund its development and gave his blessing to the project. After being the first university in England to welcome students from all backgrounds, it became the first university of the country to admit women on equal terms with men. Today, UCL is considered one of the UK’s leading universities and has welcomed prestigious students such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Crick\">Francis Crick</a>&nbsp;(co-discoverer of the DNA structure), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi\">Mahatma Gandhi</a>&nbsp;(leader of the Indian independence) and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Higgs\">Peter Higgs</a>&nbsp;(winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics, 2013), to name a few.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"embeddedImage","value":{"non-repeat":{"caption":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"University College London","spans":[]}}],"image":{"origin":{"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/ucl.jpg","width":721,"height":576},"width":721,"height":576,"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/ucl.jpg","edit":{"background":"transparent","zoom":1,"crop":{"x":0,"y":0}},"alt":"University College London","thumbnails":{}},"weight":"default"}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"The young, dynamic and thriving atmosphere surrounding UCL and the whole Bloomsbury area kept attracting scholars in the 20th&nbsp;century – best represented by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsbury_Group\">Bloomsbury Group</a>, of which <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Woolf\">Virginia Wolf</a> was considered to be the leader.
