It’s bitterly cold; the air temperature is rarely above freezing. And it’s very dry. Although we can see that the planet has polar ice caps, there’s no sign of any liquid water – which is essential for life – anywhere. It all seems to be either frozen or evaporating into the atmosphere.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"To make matters worse, Mars has no magnetic shield, no ozone layer, and only a very thin atmosphere, so its surface is exposed to intense levels of radiation, including UV and ionising cosmic rays, which damage and destroy DNA.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"As Dartnell explained, we’re protected from cosmic radiation by our planet’s “lovely deep atmosphere,” which absorbs high-energy particles in cosmic rays, and a magnetic shield, which deflects them.

Dartnell says the bacteria have a number of quirks in their biochemistry that protect them. While they can’t directly protect themselves from the gamma rays, which are powerful enough to go through rock, they are very good at repairing the damage those rays do to their DNA. A suite of repair enzymes piece the damaged genome together again. Moreover, each cell or bacteria has up to 12 or more copies of its genome, whereas humans only have one copy in each of our cells.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"The <em>deinococcus</em>’s<em></em>ability to piece itself together again, in the right order, is of great interest to genetic engineers, who are looking to apply its molecular biology to other cells to develop new medicines or forms of bio-remediation. It might be possible to engineer organisms that can survive radiation and clean up oil slicks and toxic waste, for example.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"As well as testing his bugs’ impressive survival rates, for his PhD Dr Dartnell worked with physicists, mathematicians and computer programmers at UCL to develop a computer simulation of the radiation on the surface of Mars.

So the ExoMars robot will wait for night on Mars, and then scan the landscape and rocks with a UV laser, looking for protective nooks and cavities, where microbes might be hiding. If those crevices fluoresce in the dark, it could be a sign of life. The robot will then fish out an armful of soil and deliver it into the onboard instruments for analysis.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"In the meantime, researchers are looking at the space material that’s already delivered to us. We know that the building blocks of life can begin in outer space. Meteorites, what Dartnell calls the “builder’s rubble left over from the making of the planets”, made of silica rocks, contain large amounts of carbon. And carbon is good at sticking together to make organic compounds. Add sources of energy from the sun or from radioactive decay in the asteroids, and sometimes water to the mix, and the chemistry results in organic molecules.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"The Murchison meteorite, which fell near Murchison in Australia in 1969 apparently, reeked of petro-chemicals and organic molecules, when it was first picked up.
