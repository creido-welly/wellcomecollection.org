Over 30 per cent of London residents have experienced mental disorders, 19 per cent have had suicidal thoughts and 11 per cent have attempted suicide. More time is lost at work through mental health issues than through musculoskeletal disorders. Worse, 90 per cent of people with mental health problems have encountered stigma and discrimination at work and in society at large. Mental health needs to be at the centre of a virtuous circle of changing attitudes, Paul argued.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<a href=\"http://www.infowccommissioning.com/programme/effectively-using-reporting-mechanisms-to-inform-commissioning-from-the-bottom-up/bobbie-jacobson\">Bobbie Jacobson</a> argued for taking on&nbsp;<a href=\"../../../../../2010/10/06/sick-city-child-poverty/\">child poverty</a>. We all were children once, and 56 per cent of London’s children today are prevented from living a full participative life due to poverty. Even the richest London borough is without pockets of abject poverty. Any map of health problems is a map structured by an underlying map of poverty. Merely raising awareness of the problem without suggesting a solution is pointless, argued Bobbie. Her solution is the <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/media/press_releases_mayoral/mayor-increases-london-living-wage-four-international-employers-sign\">London Living Wage</a>, a London-specific minimum wage of £7.85/hour, which takes into account the higher cost of living in London. There are half a million businesses in London, and all of them need to pay the London living wage.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<a href=\"http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/people/a.lalvani/\">Ajit Lalvani</a> made the case for <a href=\"../../../../../2010/10/05/sick-city-tuberculosis/\">tackling tuberculosis</a>, a medieval scourge that many might be surprised to find on the agenda. TB was the only threat presented to the audience that is an infectious disease. We might think of ourselves as beyond the age of cholera, but SARS, also a respiratory disease, caused 2 million deaths among 9m cases worldwide in its recent outbreak. London is the only western European capital with rising rates of TB, which is acquiring drug resistance and can kill in as little as 16 days. Latent TB, which can show no symptoms, is a silent killer – the full scale of which is unknown.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Finally, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Maryon-Davis\">Alan Maryon-Davis</a> proposed <a href=\"../../../../../2010/10/04/sick-city-childhood-obesity/\">childhood obesity</a> as London’s biggest health challenge. At current rates, by 2025, half the male population of London will be clinically obese. Overweight children are not only subject to teasing and low achievement at school, but massively increase their risk of ill-health from heart disease, diabetes and cancer, reducing their life expectancy by the same amount as smoking. In order to avoid a generation of children dying younger than their parents, we need to promote both healthy physical activity and better awareness of healthy cooking.

Paul answered that in fact much of Mind’s campaigning has been inspired by a similar effort in New  Zealand; Bobbie suggested that we could, in fact, look to other countries like Cuba, where equality and healthcare are taken much more seriously.
