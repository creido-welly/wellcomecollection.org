There’s also Al Oudh by l’Artisan Parfumeur which smells of armpits in Istanbul, and Sables by Annick Goutal whose tarry, sandy, salty tang is a bit like a well-worn sailing sweater cast aside in the summer heat.

It’s all about memory and association and is more complicated than you’d think.

It seemed that as the scents got ‘dirtier’, they became more complex –&nbsp;I couldn’t believe anyone would pay top dollar for perfume #1 when they could spritz themselves with good ol’ Fairy Liquid –&nbsp;or maybe we became more sensitive to combinations of fragrance notes as the evening progressed and our noses became more experienced.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"After scents that smelt like cedar wood –&nbsp;or was it otter spraint?

Or so it seemed at first: a powdery violet that smelt overpoweringly of the bottom of old lady’s handbag. Maybe its intensity indicated an ironic take designed to be worn with a kitsch vintage tea dress –&nbsp;but it didn’t smell <em>dirty</em>… until you waited… and caught a whiff of an undertone that was distinctly less cut-and-dried. This one turned out to be anti-perfumer Etat Libre d’Orange’s&nbsp;<em>Putain des Palaces</em> – and hints as the real reason we love to smell dirty.
