Thanks to the worldwide phenomenon Harry Potter, the only people that haven’t heard of King’s Cross – and of platform 9 ¾ – are the ones that are too young to have read the books yet.

The area is also traditionally recognised as the location of the legendary battle between <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boudica\">Boudica</a>, the warriors Queen of the Iceni, against the Roman invaders in AD 61.

The completion of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regent%27s_Canal\">Regent’s Canal</a> in 1920 ensured the connection between King’s Cross and other major industrial cities in northern England. The railway industry established itself in area by the mid-19th&nbsp;century, when the first temporary passenger station opened in 1850 north of the canal. This station remained in use until the inauguration of King’s Cross station in 1852. The Metropolitan Railway, the world’s first underground railway, was also completed at this time. The temporary station subsequently became part of a wholesale potato market. The railway development at King’s Cross in the mid-19th&nbsp;century was also associated with intense demolition campaigns, including the destruction of housing buildings, which contributed to the overcrowding of the area.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"The mid-20th&nbsp;century was a turning point in the history of King’s Cross. The site’s status of ‘wasteland’ changed in response to the decline of the industries that used to flourish there. King’s Cross went from being a busy industrial zone to an under-used site. Such a shift in the land’s economy had a strong impact on the local community; many lost their work associated with the transport of freight activities and various buildings were abandoned, leaving the area in a dramatic state of decline. It is from this desolate landscape that idea of a ‘dodgy’ King’s Cross was born.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"By the 1980s and 1990s, King’s Cross was often associated with working-class, and the issues of poverty, racism, drugs and prostitution.&nbsp;Mike Leigh’s 1988 movie <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Hopes_%281988_film%29\">High Hopes</a></em> focuses on a working-class family living in King’s Cross, exploring the political and social classes of the area’s inhabitants.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"King’s Cross devastated land became the soil for new generations to form their ideas and develop new industries.
