He was young and fit and healthy. It was a rather new love so remains in a perfect trouble free bubble. He died of a massive heart attack, so I did not know he had died so much as…well…I thought he was just blissed out and happy and resting…having a tantric moment. The gratitude is not for his dying. That has taken me years to get over. The gratitude is for the grace with which he passed and the beauty of this experience for me. There was a huge blessing in being chosen to midwife this powerful passing… and for it to be without any constriction or pain. I will never be afraid of death and this experience, in many very real ways, gave me my life back in a much more vibrant and whole and real way.","spans":[]}}],"source":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":null,"spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<em>You can <a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/exhibitions/infinitas-gracias/inspired-by-your-stories/about-the-illustrators/melanie-winning.aspx\">find out more about Melanie Winning’s work</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/exhibitions/infinitas-gracias/inspired-by-your-stories.aspx\">explore more votive illustrations</a> on the Wellcome Collection website.</em>","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"<em><a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/exhibitions/infinitas-gracias/inspired-by-your-stories/inspire-a-votive.aspx\">Could your gratitude inspire a votive</a>?
