The residency explored research into malaria and other tropical diseases, and the parasites and other illness-giving agents that can take over our body and cause it to react and change in a way that might be completely new to us. The ideas of these bodily possibilities, which originate when we are well and when we are ill, used ideas of movement to bring these ideas to life.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"embeddedImage","value":{"non-repeat":{"caption":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"","spans":[]}}],"image":{"origin":{"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/bfloorblog2.jpg","width":1500,"height":1000},"width":1500,"height":1000,"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/bfloorblog2.jpg","edit":{"background":"transparent","zoom":1,"crop":{"x":0,"y":0}},"alt":"Bodily Possibilities Workshop","thumbnails":{}},"weight":"default"}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Kage showed the group how to move their stomachs around like there was ‘a worm’ or a disease in them. He talked them through this new sensation, making it seem real to them through the dialogue and story he presented. It was new to them, this disease, they had never felt it before, and then it started moving all around their body and making different parts of them twitch in different ways. Eventually it hit their brains and their face. The ideas of cerebral malaria came to mind in what went from a gentle mime to one that gave terrifying fit-like movements. Eventually, although it was not explicit, Kage asked that everyone imagine they held it in their cheeks, thousands of these ‘worms’, and then spat them out. And he said, “Well done, you are all healthy again”. They had been through an illness without being ill. Could they connect with some of this feeling of being well again on a cellular level?","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"embeddedImage","value":{"non-repeat":{"caption":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"","spans":[]}}],"image":{"origin":{"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/bfloorblog3.jpg","width":1500,"height":1000},"width":1500,"height":1000,"url":"https://wellcomecollection.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/bfloorblog3.jpg","edit":{"background":"transparent","zoom":1,"crop":{"x":0,"y":0}},"alt":"Bodily Possibilities Workshop","thumbnails":{}},"weight":"default"}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Creation ideas and ideas linked with evolution followed.

When you won you evolved into multi-cellular animals, and everyone went from amoeba to worm, frog, monkey and human in a game that playfully followed in Charles Darwin’s footsteps!
