In the past decade, he has become interested in exploring what happens in the process of creating dancing material. Where do the movements come from? Where do dancers take the inspiration from? In 2000 Wayne McGregor | Random Dance started a collaboration with artists and specialists from a wide variety of disciplines such as cognitive and social sciences as well as computer software designers in an attempt to understand the creative process of making choreography. The results of this research are presented to the public in Wellcome Collection’s autumn temporary exhibition: <a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/exhibitions/thinking-with-the-body.aspx\">Thinking with the Body</a>.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"The collaboration between Wayne McGregor’s dancers and socio-cognitive researchers such as Phil Barnard and David Kirsh allowed them to identify patterns in the way dancers produce choreography materials. These patterns have been grouped in different categories that the company calls Choreographic Thinking Tools (CTTs). CTTs explore dancers’ mental imagery – acoustic, visual and body sensation – and help them become more aware of their creative potential. The twelve CTTs identified by Random Dance are presented in the gallery, where visitors are encouraged to explore them for themselves.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Technology is often used by McGregor to complement his scientific research on creativity and choreography. Lately, he has been working on developing a creative choreographic software combining artificial thinking and CTTs to an interactive object, conceived as an 11th dancer in the studio, that would stimulate dancers’ creativity. The latest version is called Becoming and is a centerpiece of the Thinking with the Body exhibition. Visitors are invited to engage with the 63-inch 3D screen and make their own choreography. If you feel a little shy, don’t turn this opportunity away: from Saturday 28 September former dancers from Random Dance will be in the gallery every Thursday, 6.00pm-9.00pm, and Saturdays-Sundays 2.00pm-5.00pm, to show you the way!","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Thinking with the Body will immerse you into Wayne McGregor’s world and help you push the limit of your own creativity.
