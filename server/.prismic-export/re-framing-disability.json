But few museums display such items. Even when these objects are publicly exhibited, museums rarely acknowledge the link with disability, and even fewer museums consult disabled people when creating their displays. Why is this? A common reason is a fear of creating offence. So how should museums tackle the ‘darker side’ of disability history, the lack of agency, the sensationalism and suppression? Would exhibits inadvertently encourage audiences to stare in a way that was reminiscent of a freak show?","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"I’m someone that likes a challenge so I was attracted to the idea of exhibiting the RCP’s historical portraits of disabled people – images that are unique, artistically interesting, and have never been on public display before.

Unearthing the lives of the people portrayed allows them to be seen by visitors as parents, husbands, artists and professionals, and not be purely defined by their impairment.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"Perhaps surprisingly, research by medical historians Carole Reeves and Julie Anderson revealed that many of the sitters in the portraits had independence and control over their lives and also earned a good income from exhibiting. <a href=\"http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/museum-and-garden/whats/re-framing-disability/matthew-buchinger-b1674-1\">Matthew Buchinger</a> (b.1674), for example, who describes himself as a ‘wonderful little man of but 29 inches high, born without hands, feet or thighs’ was paid 50 guineas – equivalent to over £3,000 today – for his exquisite self portrait pictured above. Amazingly the curls of his wig are composed of the lettering of six Biblical psalms and the Lord’s Prayer.

They are playing chess with a Portuguese naturalist who claims that their characters are similar and their minds and wills are as one. But this was not so. Chang and Eng played the system. They were discovered as children in Siam by a showman and travelled the world on the exhibition circuits. They arrived in London in 1829 aged 18, but within ten years they fired their agent and were successfully managing their own careers becoming extremely wealthy. They became US citizens, married two sisters and fathered 22 children between them.","spans":[]}}]}}},{"key":"paragraph","value":{"non-repeat":{"text":[{"type":"paragraph","content":{"text":"The project has also created a legacy of exciting positive portrayals of disabled people today – <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PALIKx1PFes\">a film interviewing the 27 disabled participants</a> was made by Deaf film makers <a href=\"http://redbirdmedia.co.uk/ted-evans\">Ted Evans</a> and <a href=\"http://redbirdmedia.co.uk/bim-ajadi\">Bim Ajadi</a>, and disabled photographer <a href=\"http://www.lynnweddle.com/lynnweddle/01-home.htm\">Lynn Weddle</a> produced&nbsp; photographic portraits of participants using a shutter release cable which gave control to the sitter: they could press the button and take their own portrait.
