This one comes from Elissavet Ntoulia.</p></div><p>Working in a museum that explores the human condition, you develop the skill of spotting connections between elements that at first glance seem to randomly coexist. Sometimes inspiration comes from as trivial a thing as the choice of furniture: a long table in our Reading Room, for example, situated at the centre of a section exploring the themes of Alchemy and Food.</p><p>Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo.

Since the advent of printing posters have been created to inform the public of what they must do (sometimes on pain of death) in response to outbreaks of plague or other infectious diseases.</p><p>Apart from major epidemics, war is the crisis which tends to elicit the most public health posters: in both World War I and World War II many posters were produced to save the soldiers from syphilis and typhoid, and to encourage the population to keep fit for fighting. In peacetime, the 20th century saw a decline in the public health poster, as acute infectious diseases became less prominent and chronic degenerative diseases more burdensome.</p><ul><li>one</li><li>two</li><li>three</li><li>four</li><li>five</li></ul><p>The emergence of the AIDS crisis (as it was perceived to be) in 1981 therefore bucked a trend. It saw the staffs of local authorities, health providers and even central governments reverting to the practices of their parents and grand-parents in the 1940s and commissioning new designs to protect people from the new disease, AIDS. Officials who never thought they would be involved in such activities found themselves in advertising offices and artists' studios approving designs for multi-million pound publicity campaigns. These campaigns continued for over 20 years, and in some parts of the world are still going strong in the second decade of the 21st century.</p><p>This reversion to an earlier way of doing things is perhaps all the more surprising because the decades in which the AIDS poster campaigns have flourished were the very decades in which the internet was introduced, browsers were created, and billions of web pages were published. Many a campaign was accompanied by the warning 'this will be our last poster campaign - in future everyone will get their information from the web'. There was plenty of electronic campaigning, especially through the 'Stop AIDS' campaign, with its ubiquitous pink condom. But paper posters continued because of their greater presence, durability and immediacy in the real world of the street, the nightclub and the support group.</p>"
