#Â Terraform config

This section of the terraform setup is to allow us to recreate anything we might need
from the [backend setup](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/index.html).

There is no idea of a shared state we would then have to have a state lock table for 
this project and that will all start to get a little bit meta.
