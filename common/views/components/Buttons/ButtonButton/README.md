### Primary button
Main call to action on the page, e.g. 'Booking' or 'Sign up' - may include an icon.

### Secondary button
Used alongside the primary button as a supporting action, e.g. 'Cancel'.

### Tertiary button
Used to define multiple actions which should be separated from page content.

These can be called either as a `button` or an `a` element, using the `<ButtonButton />` or `<LinkButton />` components.
