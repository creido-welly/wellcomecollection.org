### Controls
Used in application with a UI component, e.g. launch image viewer.

Light and Dark variants are to be chosen on a case-by-case basis according to their surroundings, rather than implying more or less significance.

These can be called either as a `button` or an `a` element, based on whether or not a `url` prop is passed in.
