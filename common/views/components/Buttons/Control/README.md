### Controls
e.g. 'Next' 'Previous' on Image carousel, 'Zoom' on Works page

Used to control the display of a component.

Light and Dark variants are to be chosen on a case-by-case basis according to their surroundings, rather than implying more or less significance. Use Dark button to make it prominent when displayed over image.

These can be called either as a `button` or an `a` element, based on whether or not a `url` prop is passed in.
