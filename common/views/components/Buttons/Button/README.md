## Primary button
e.g. 'Book tickets' on Events page
Used for main call to action in a component or page. (single action?)
May include an icon to emphasise the function.

### Secondary button
Used alongside the primary button as a supporting action, e.g. 'Cancel'.

### Tertiary button
Used to define multiple actions which should be separated from page content.

These will be called either as a `button` or an `a` element, based on whether a `url` prop is passed in.
